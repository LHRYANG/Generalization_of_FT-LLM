I'd never been there before, and everyone is always telling me how good the food is, so I was quite excited. \\n\\nBefore I even arrived, Heather sent me a text message that I can paraphrase with: The chairs are so uncomfortable, I think I'm going to cry. \\n\\nI called her and told her we should go somewhere else if she was so uncomfortable (oh, I should mention that Heather is pregnant ... with twins). Just then, Joe walked in and saved the day (dun-dun-da-da!) with a plush towel he happened to have in his car. Ahh ... Heather's tush was now at ease. \\n\\nWhen I arrived, Joe and Heather had already decided to get the Queso Fundido: Roasted poblanos, sauteed spinach, mushrooms and melted Oaxacan cheese with queso fresco & chorizo. It was served with chips and bread, and it was delicious. \\n\\nJoe and I also ordered la Sangria, which is their Sangria made with red wine, mango puree & Jack Daniels. This was also quite yummy - I'd love to try to recreate it at home.\\n\\nBoth Joe and Heather got the Enchiladas de Mole, which the waiter actually hesitated on and warned them that not everyone likes it. Heather and Joe were perplexed ... They like mole ... Apparently some people who like mole don't like the mole at Barrio Cafe ... Flashforward to the end of the meal: Neither Joe or Heather really thought the mole was that great.\\n\\nI tried something completely different and got the Enchiladas de Hongos, sauteed wild mushroom melange with queso de cabra and aciete de trufa blanca. They pretty much had me at goat cheese (oops, I mean queso de cabra). Complimenting the dish were roasted vegetables that were so sweet .... Mmmm .... the cheese was light and fluffy, and the white corn tortillas were so soft that the enchiladas tasted like a Mexican version of cheese blintzes. \\n\\nI stopped myself from over-eating (although, it was so good, it took some major effort), and now I have leftovers to enjoy for lunch tomorrow.

I'm here with 6 friends, so I didn't actually order ALL this food. \\n\\nDecor: Love this Asian fusion restaurant. The decor is so cute. Especialy love the wallpaper and the \\\"\"let's nhau\\\"\" quote (vietnamese for let's party/drink) in the corner of the room. There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.\\n\\nThe CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.\\n\\nAppetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.\\n\\nEntree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.\\n\\nOverall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool. It definitely feels like a family friendly environment.

View of parking garage. There was some long black curtains with a stand hanging in front of the door to the room across from us and it looked like they just needed a place to stick it and decided next to our room! Also, there was a tray of beer and old food that looked like it had been sitting there for days. We had to walk around it each time we went to our room. \\n\\nThe room: BLAH. The floor was stained (looked like many people had thrown up on it over the years...) there was candy on the floor from the previous guests. Other than that it seemed clean enough. Nothing special at all, no fridge, no wifi, and all the outlets but one were taken so no charging your phone next to the bed! The safe didn't work, it was open and wouldn't shut. I called the front desk and they sent up security who demanded my ID like a criminal. They said any time they open the safe they have to check ID. I proceeded to tell him the safe was OPEN and nothing was in it so why do I need to show ID? He snapped at me that if I had a problem with their policies to take it up with the front desk. I did and they gave me a $50 credit. They also had to send up 2 more people before the safe got fixed. Also complained about the food sitting outside of our room for over a day and they finally came and picked it up. \\n\\nWent to the pool the next day. It was good enough but I've been to better in Vegas. Also the wave pool was dirty lots of \\\"\"debris\\\"\" in it. Came back to the room and it had only been halfway cleaned. Again called to the front desk and they offered to send someone up but at that point we were trying to get ready for a night out so we declined. On our way out we heard someone else on our floor say their room was only halfway cleaned too. The next day we had a housekeeping supervisor come to our room and tell us she thoroughly cleaned our room. Parts of the room looked spotless and then parts were still not done like the day before. \\n\\nLast day for check out I wanted to just do express checkout, reviewed my bill and the $50 credit was not applied. Had to wait in a very long line to speak with someone to get it applied. Overall I was dissatisfied with our trip and I will not be staying here again.

I took note.\\n\\nThis year, at the end of a traditional/annual BFF/coworker trip, Sarah E, Sarah M, KarKar, and I spent an extra day in Vegas, the start of which led us to this same spot for lunch, touting it's sangria. It did not disappoint my hazy recollection.\\n\\nWe were quickly seated by the hostess, the restaurant/\\\"\"patio\\\"\" on the waterfront being sparsely occupied on a Tuesday afternoon. Julio, our server - an elder but spirited gentleman - came over with menus, introduced himself, and immediately prompted us for drinks to start...\\n\\\"\"A pitcher of sangria, please?\\\"\"\\n\\\"\"Excellente. Four glasses?\\n\\\"\"Yes, please. Thank you.\\\"\"\\n\\nWith drinks on their way and requisite chips & salsa on the table, lunch/sustenance was in order. Both Sarahs ordered the Tres Tacos plates while KarKar went with lighter fare, having a bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Soup. I ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, thinking it would be like... um, one big quesadilla, but they (3) were [pleasantly] more akin to grill flattened/pressed tacos.\\n\\nThe Corn & Green Chile soup was flavorful! A bit of sweet from the corn, heat from the green chile, a hearty fullness of potato, and depth/salt from smoked bacon.\\n\\nThe taco combination platters and the smoked chicken quesadilla plate satisfying and freshly flavored. Each taco was dressed with toppings complimentary to their filling - shredded chicken salpicon, mushrooms with queso blanco/fresco, and [grilled] fish with a pineapple salsa. The three palm-sized smoked chicken quesadillas are heavy with chicken and cheese. Both platters come garnished with a sharp and tangy serano slaw, black beans, and fresh flavorful cilantro rice.\\n\\nBack to what brought us here... the Sangria.\\n\\nNow its hard to tell (especially in Vegas) just how good/effective a sangria can be. It's *meant* to creep, right? (JM, Cobes, and I went 2-3 carafes not realizing the fade!) But I must say, the sangria here is good. Not too tart, not too sweet. Retains the silken feel of red wine and the warm flush of brandy is subtle. It's a slow ride into troubled waters. What a perfect way to ease into the crazy. Gimme more!\\n\\nSafe to say, for casual dining, good people watching, and a creeper of a drink, I'd gladly add Canonita to the yearly tradition.\\n_________________________________________________\\nNo, really.

I personally go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and try to average 1 - 2 fine dining meals a trip. Earlier this trip my fiancee and I ate at Barrymore and we both felt that the meal at Morels was significantly better.\\n\\nThe reasons our group enjoyed our meal at Morels:\\nService: I was the last of the group to arrive, so I do not know how the host / hostess did with the initial greeting. I do know that our party was seated promptly and professionally. Our waiter (Jake, I think) did an excellent job of answering menu questions and making recommendations. We had one vegetarian in the group and the chef made her a special pasta dish that was not on the menu. The support staff, sommelier and management were all extremely friendly and attentive.\\n\\nFood: The food was OUTSTANDING. We had 2 meat and cheese plates to start things off and they set the tone for the rest of the evening. Our group ordered oysters in the half shell (they had 4 varieties that evening) and those of us that ate them enjoyed them. Morels offers a Caesar salad for 2 that is prepared tableside and it is delicious. 80% of the group ordered steak, breaking down to 6 filets and 1 porterhouse that was split by 2 folks. I was one of the guys enjoying the porterhouse and it was fantastic. All steaks were cooked to proper temperature. In terms of side dishes, I had tastes of the asparagus, mac n' cheese and french fries. I felt the mac n' cheese was very good and the other 2 sides were solid. The french fries are skinny cut, not thick steak fries. We also ordered a few desserts, my personal favorite were the doughnuts with jam. The overall quality of the food was excellent.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was not very crowded when we arrived, and the atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable. There was one other large party at the restaurant when we were seated and their presence did not affect our service or enjoyment of the dining area. After our meal, we went out on the balcony, which overlooks The Strip, and enjoyed a few after dinner drinks. By the time we left, the dining room was significantly busier but not too loud. \\n\\nLike any good steak restaurant, your meal will not be inexpensive. The question is: Do you feel like you got your money's worth at the end of the evening? Our group's response to this question is an overwhelming \\\"\"YES!\\\"\". I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant and plan on going back in October.",

The fish sauce vinaigrette that came with it was good also. Not overly potent. The eggroll were okay. Not awful, but wasn't amazing. I was a little disappointed that it did not come with lettuce and herbs to eat it as a wrap. This is how it's usually served at Vietnamese restaurants. I actually ended up slicing it up and mixing it in with my Banh Cuon. :)\\n\\nI can see this as a place I would put in my dining rotation.

It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. \\n\\n\\\"\"Here the love of God, through Jesus,\\nIs revealed in time and space;\\nAs we share in Christ the feast that frees us:\\n\\nAll are welcome, all are welcome,\\nAll are welcome in this place.\\\"\"",

The only salt was from the cheese, which you could taste in the last bite (as all the toppings were eaten already.)  I would never go back, and will never eat at a Ramsay restaurant again.  To \\\"\"rectify\\\"\" the issue with yet another unseasoned burger told me that it was intended to be bland.  No thanks, for over $50 I could have eaten three times the amount at In N Out burger and been completely satisfied!  (Oh yes, the fries were ok, more garlicy than truffley...but the meal cannot be held up by the fries.)",

It was totally out of place and totally uncalled for.\\n\\nWe were finishing lunch and the General Manager approahced our table -- no other table -- our table.  His conversation was directed at my 87 year old grey haired mother.  He began by pulling some $5 coupons out of his shirt pocket and asking her if she'd like to have a coupon she could use in January.  After baiting her with his pitch, he sprung the rest of the sales pitch on her.  She could have one if she'd buy a $25 gift card.  We were shocked.  It was totally out of place.  If he wants to sell coupons, he's definitely in the wrong job.  \\n\\nNormally when a general manager visits a table it's to ask how everything is and if he can do anything for his patrons, not to see them coupons.\\n\\nRegardless of any other stars we'd give this restaurant, we won't return.  We go out to eat not to be hassled by a manager coming to our table to try to sell us something.  I could understand at the cash register offering gift cards with a $5 coupon but not at the table and not the way this manager presented it.  I think he needs a training in etiquette before he's let loose in a restaurant. \\n\\nSo, I dropped an email to corporate headquarters.  They forwarded it on to the Mimi's in Chandler.  This morning I received a form letter in my email from the Service Manager.  Yes, it was definitely a form letter and it definitely had obvious misspelled words -- not typos.   And, why is it they always think they can make things better by offering a free meal and not even addressing the problem?  We definitely won't use it.\\n\\n-- Hostess was pleasant and efficient.

Water was filled, but then put back randomly onto the table, leaving us to guess which water glass belonged to which diner. The food (I'll get to the quality of this in a moment) came out in three to five minute intervals - clearly the kitchen had no concept of timing the completion of the dishes. Okay - the food. Because despite all of these things, it is possible that food can save a restaurant. Not here. The appetizers were the best part of the meal, and they were sub-par at best.

He began working at the arena as a young teen, and continued to do so while he pursued his college degree in Accounting.  He went on to play pro hockey, winning a championship, and returned to the arena after a spending a short time as an accountant - because Arcadia Ice Arena means everything to him.\\n\\nPlain and simple - this place is still open because Jim loves hockey and he knows creative accounting.  He pours his heart and soul into this arena, and employs teens that could use a little mentoring.  Arcadia is lucky to have him.\\n\\nYeah - the facilities are a little rough around the edges but that's hockey.  Jim showed me locker room repairs he'd made just a few days prior, explaining to me that its an impossible task to keep kids from smashing hockey sticks into everything; as a former child skater, I can relate wholeheartedly.\\n\\nAnyway, here's the best part.  At the rear of the arena, tucked behind the buildings, is my favorite bar in all of Phoenix.  Its a little divey, but its something special.  There's a few games, a free-standing fireplace, along with cold beer and an always-friendly bartender.  Behind her is a wall of glass, allowing you to watch the action on the rink from your bar stool.  I've never seen anything like it, and I guarantee you haven't either.

Sadly, like the retirement accounts of so many so-called middle class Americans, these places have vanished along with their many customers, who no longer can afford to spend money on such non-essential luxuries.\\n\\nFortunately, Warsaw Village survived the economic catastrophe, though, like lots of businesses, it did so by considerably paring down its selection to avoid wastage and lost revenues therefrom.  Sadly, the shelves are no longer full in this store and for those who remember 'the good days', it's sort of sad to see.  Some of the now missing items are in the back; but a lot of it simply isn't carried anymore, because there just aren't as many customers showing up to buy anymore (or so it seems).  Every time I want to stop by here to pick up something, I always get a little churn in the pit of my stomach ... II keep expecting to show up and they won't be there anymore.\\n\\nWhile places like Jana's Bakery has (finally) expanded their selection of non-bakery items on sale, Warsaw Village is still the place to go in the West Valley (actually, the WHOLE Valley) to buy a wide assortment of Polish dry goods, meats, alcohol, pickled vegetables and, especially, pierogi.  Their selection just can't be beat and they don't try and bulk up their offerings by throwing in Bosnian and other former Yugoslavian items, like many 'ethnic' places do to make it seem like they have more than they do.  None of that cheap, sketchy stuff is here:  the overwhelming majority of what they have on hand is Polish or made by places in the States specializing in Polish foodstuffs.  It simply is THE place to go to buy all these things (sadly, though, you need to skip the bread and Makowiec they pick up from other bakeries in the area ... they're usually not fresh by the time you get to it here).\\n\\nMaybe, one day, when all the financial misery is behind us, places like Warsaw Village will once more open up and thrive as they did in better days.  For now, go and look and buy ... you may not have the opportunity to do so tomorrow.",

Well my wife and I have been back to Biaggio's many times now ( 5 times I think) and the food has been great every time!  I read some of the reviews on here complaining about Biaggio increasing the size of food or giving them food while they wait or if they ask how something is!?!?!  Really people this is something to complain about?  I guess I am confused, people saying don't be bought by the owner Biaggio.  Well unless I am confused about the process of business, a business supplies a service, the public enjoys the service and wants more of it, thus returning many times to have the service again.  So by Biaggio giving AMAZING service and product; I am some how selling my soul.  THIS IS WHAT IS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN AT A RESTAURANT!!!!  I guess some of you Yelpers have had such poor service for so long you have forgotten.  Look it is simple!\\n1.  AMAZING SERVICE\\n2.  AMAZING FOOD\\n3.  OWNER TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY\\n4.  GO BACK OFTEN!!!\\nNone of this means anything shady is happening.  If I owned a store I would want return customers and for them to tell people about my store, this is good business and what A LOT of restaurants in the Valley could use lessons in.  Stop reading so much into it and go enjoy good food with good people at Biaggio's.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention they deliver ANYWHERE in Vegas...who does that?  How is this not 5 stars.  I also will not try to compare this to pizza in NY or Chicago, it is great pizza in Vegas.  So unless you plan on going 2500 miles for a slice do yourself a favor and don't over think it.

We were craving Italian tonight, so boyfriend and I decided on this place. \\n We got seated pretty quick, and right off the bat you can see waiters running around like chickens with their heads cut off! It was pretty busy inside so maybe that's a good sign the food is great?\\n As we got seated, it took about 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and when we did, our waiter only asked me what I wanted... My beau was not pleased but let it slide. When he came back, we wanted a beer and asked for a recommendation, and when we asked how it tasted, he said..\\\"\"it tastes like Italian beer\\\"\". Wow, but of course!!! How stupid am I!!! So after we received our Italian beer, it took another 10 minutes to get complimentary bread... We were some what annoyed, but not too hurt since our check in included 20% off our meal!! (Thanks yelp!) so here is what we ordered:\\n\\n- fried gnocchi\\n- lobster ravioli \\n- pappardelle with shrimp and saffron sauce\\n\\n Fried gnocchi was not crispy as imagined, quite soggy actually, but the gnocchi itself was tasty... Or so I thought for the first 3 bites. There was a weird taste, almost like a smelly mildewy cheese taste. I thought there was cheese inside, but there wasn't... Only 4 pieces tasted like that. Grossed out!!!\\n Lobster ravioli was descent, but the filling was a bit too fishy. The sauce and pasta were cooked perfectly though. \\n The pappardelle pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, saffron sauce was amazing (wish there was more of it since it seemed more like a coating) and there was a good amount of shrimp, all which were a decent size and perfectly cooked.\\nThe bread we received was nice and crusty, although it took about 15 minutes for the second order. \\n\\nIn general, this place was just ok. They have specialty pizzas so maybe they're more popular with that. The atmosphere seemed crazy rather than a romantic little restaurant in Italy. Everyone seemed rushed, no one seemed friendly, and it almost felt like if you took too long on ordering or asked for assistance, they put a curse upon you! Thank goodness for that discount, and pricing was reasonable ($65), but other than those reasons, I wouldn't return. That's too bad since my saffron pappardelle was delicious!!! Plus it's not worth the 45 minute drive. \\n I hope this place realizes that there's no business if the customer doesn't feel warm and welcome. Hopefully some staff retraining will help. I hope so, because guests will flock if the food and service is top priority... Plus, they need it all the way in lake Las Vegas... Just saying!!!!!",

I was expecting a banana chip, but it was a battered slice of banana.

A few dishes have been great, like the honey walnut chicken and fried dumplings, and a few not so good, like the pad thai. The staff seem friendly, and given the price I just overlooked the odd chaos. By chaos, I mean that your food will come in no particular order, and each dish might come out separately. The dumplings might come after the main dishes - I just rolled with it. The kitchen has not figured out how to make one table's dishes timed correctly, and that hasn't changed over the past few months. \\n\\nI have always seen a large Asian clientele, and that's great for them. However, it seemed to me that sometimes the Asian patrons were getting hooked up with their food before us whites, but I never saw an actual pattern, and like I said the kitchen is not well timed so I never worried about it.\\n\\nUntil tonight. We ordered dumplings, two main dishes, and two bowls of white rice. The dumplings came out first, and I had to call the woman back because we had no utensils, napkins, plates, etc. She brought back utensils, but no plates. My guy went up to get them. As we were eating our dumplings, a party of 6 Asian Americans came in and ordered. As they sat next to us, the woman working the register brought out our main dishes - but no rice. When I asked where it was, she said they were out. I have never, ever, been to an Asian restaurant that ran out of rice, but this one is pretty chaotic. She said they were making more.\\n\\nWe start picking at our main dishes (because they really needed white rice to eat!) when I saw the woman bring a large bowl of white rice to a table behind us, who had been seated before we got there. Good, I thought, it's cooked. So then the woman brings over another bowl of white rice - and sets it on the table next to us. It's for the table of Asians who arrived at least ten minutes after us, have no other food on their table, and with whom the lady jokes for a minute. She then heads away, ignoring us. \\n\\nMy husband went up to the counter to ask where our rice was. The woman says there isn't any ready, and he asks why the other party got some, when we were clearly next in line, had our main dishes, and they had nothing yet. She acted as if she could not understand the issue. Finally, a few minutes later she wanders over with rice and asks if we want it. We declined. \\n\\nAs a White chick, I haven't been discriminated against often, but this really, really felt like discrimination. I won't ever go back.",

She had to move me into another room because the equipment was working, and then moved me back to the other room to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came in, looked at my X-rays, looked at my teeth and then explained that I needed a couple fillings replaced.  He was pretty brief, but thorough enough.  Next the hygienist was running behind, so I waited about 15 minutes in the lobby for her.  When she was ready, she took me into yet another room.  At this point I was a little annoyed with the musical chairs, and asked her how long she anticipated the cleaning would take.  She said it would \\\"\"depend\\\"\"!

The office manager proceeded to patronize me and tell me that I was misinformed and the pricing was right.

FINALLY, an outside beer garden downtown :)\\n\\nWhen you arrive, the building has an exposed, dark, weathered wood look to it.  There's outside seating in the front of the restaurant, a few high top tables and bar area inside and a lot more table seating in the back garden.  It's definitely a great concept and once the misters are working, the back section will be great for the hot summer coming up!  The staff are always super nice and friendly.  I love the uniforms:  chambray tops and red TOMS for the girls and nice bow ties and other dapper accents for the guys.  Super trendy.  Every time I hang out there, I end up getting a lot of stuff and having a lot of questions.  The staff are all very patient which I appreciate.\\n\\nFor Drinks:  They have A LOT of beers.  A LOT!  I love the options.  You have the regular Coors lights, Coronas and Guinnesses.  They also have other eclectic options like the banana bread beer and my favorite, the grapefruit beer!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)  The prices range from $5-$10 depending on the beer.  I also highly recommend the Unicorn, a mixed drink that includes a lot of Ginger.  Ginger beer!  Finally, my other favorite option is the pick a beer and shot for $10.  It's a list of about 5 beers and 5 shots.  I usually get the Guinness and Fireball Whiskey shot with this deal.  \\n\\nFor Food:  The Bar Bites for $8 is AH-MAZE-ING!  Corn flake crusted chicken tenders over fries or tater tots.  Then there's the sweet potato tots!  OMG, they serve it with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  You can also ask for a sriracha ketchup but please be advised:  NO ranch or regular ketchup is offered at all!  I also love the chicken and waffle sandwich for $10.  The chicken is crusted with Capt 'n Crunch, between waffles and drizzled with Wild Turkey maple syrup.  Also served with either fries or tots.  The popular and only sides are the fries, tots or potato salad for $4 each.  The potato salad is creamy and full of soft potato chunks.  \\n\\nAs you can see from my review, I've visited this place enough to know a few great meals.  I definitely invite you to check this place out.  It's the first business welcoming you into Fremont East.

And Travelocity didn't warn about all the fees you will incur when you do check in with Spirit (which I really think they should do since they aren't like other airlines). \\n\\nI'm pretty sure if you sneezed and asked for a tissue, a flight attendant would charge you for it.  I am a really anxious flier, so for me I need to sit in the window and see what's happening.  I checked in like I would with any flight to pick my seat, and if you want to actually choose your seat you pay at least $18 for it.  Otherwise you can let them assign you and maybe you won't be shoved in the middle.  I don't like this, no other airline does this.  It's a rip off.  Bags were also a few dollars more, and the weight limit is 10 lbs. less than every other airline.  Strike two.  Between picking a normal seat (nothing special...and don't expect leg room) and checking my bags it was about $100 extra.  What a rip off.  Oh, and if you want to carry-on instead of checking, you will pay about $100, so don't waste your money.  They will find a way to make you pay. They also destroyed my luggage, and this suitcase is pretty indestructible.\\n\\nThe leg room is non-existent, and you feel like you are riding a greyhound in the sky.  The plane seems like it is about to fall apart at any moment, and if you feel cramped in a regular airplane, this will make you feel claustrophobic.

We are not  donut connoisseurs or food snobs so our expectations are pretty fair and reasonable. We usually buy donuts from Walmart or Albertsons but will make a trip out to Krispy Kreme on occasion. We are big junk food eaters though so when my wife and I first heard a Dunkin' Donuts was going into the shopping plaza we were very excited. The day it opened there was some buzz in our neighborhood and within a few days we stopped in with the family.\\n\\nMy first thought was disappointment in the variety and selection. Years ago when I use to visit a different Dunkin' Donuts on a semi-regular basis I really enjoyed all the different types of donuts from jelly and kreme filled to glazed and chocolate cake. They didnt have chocolate or bavarian kreme filled. None of the chocolate covered cake donuts. Frankly the selection is much better at the Super Walmart down the road.\\n\\nWe quickly picked a dozen donuts and headed home eager to dig in. Again, we were only disappointed. The vanilla kreme filled donuts were incredibly skimpy on filling. The glazed donuts were dense and not light and fluffy. Two days later we ended up throwing away 4 left over donuts and that has NEVER happened in this house.\\n\\nThe second trip was nearly identical. We were disappointed by the selection and the taste/quality was an even bigger disappointment. I can only assume they must be trying to cut costs by being so skimpy with the donut filling. \\n\\nIn passing conversations with others in our neighborhood they've expressed similar experiences. We will not be returning for a third trip. Its back to Walmart and Albertson's donuts until Krispy Kreme builds a store a little closer to our house.

The scrambled eggs were so overcooked they were hard and rubbery, the potatoes were very undercooked, and the biscuit was dry and literally had no flavor.  None.  The service seriously lacked as well.  No one was unfriendly, just incompetent.\\n\\nWe thought the dessert would redeem them but after paying so much for a single slice of cheesecake we couldn't even finish it.  One slice was dried out and the other cheesecake had too much sour cream - it was actually mushy and very sour, almost spoiled tasting.\\n\\nBottom line, I found this place to be mediocre at best, and that's being generous. There's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city.  Never going back, and I think the food has made me ill.",

However, we happened to pass by this time on a Saturday at 4 PM and walked right into the last table. \\n\\nThe service here is simple and fast. There is really only one server, host, chef, and busser working the entire place. Although it is small, I am still impressed at how they coordinate and work together to serve everyone. Right when you need them, they are there and when you don't, they're gone. Why do other places have such trouble figuring this balance out? Clearly, the employees at Pizzeria Bianco are sharp, skilled, and care about meeting customers' needs. Our pizza arrived literally three minutes after we ordered.\\n\\nThe pizza is cooked in a brick oven, which leaves the crust nice and crispy, the cheese gooey, and the toppings juicy. We tried the Sonny Boy, which comes with tomato sauce, mozzarella, olives, and salami. Everything was cooked perfectly and the thin crust is much appreciated. The olives are quite powerful, so be careful if you aren't a fan of those. The salami topping was crispy and flavorful. The pizza came with a ton of toppings that covered the whole thing. The sweet organic iced tea was refreshing to drink.\\n\\nThe pizza had six large, thin slices and was perfect as a light meal for two. Heavy eaters and larger parties will probably need to order a few pizzas. We came just before the dinner rush and got in without trouble.\\n\\nI recommend Pizzeria Bianco for a light and tasty brick oven pizza in a local, friendly atmosphere. Visit during off-peak hours to avoid long wait times.",

Just because you give me a massive patty plopped between a sky high bun does not make the value any better.  The patty itself was at least an inch and a half thick, so when I requested my burger to be cooked medium, I got something closer to well done around the outside with only a sliver of pink on the inside.  Not so cool.  The burger itself was very bland.  You can't just throw ground sirloin on a grill and call it a burger.  There needs to be some love and seasoning or else it just won't work.  I did like the barbecue sauce, but that was it.  The bacon had no flavor and added nothing in terms of texture, unless you want to call tough and chewy an improvement.  The crispy onions, my most anticipated feature, were actually the worse.  It seemed to me like they were fried way in advance, allowed to cool, and then stuck on there.  They were cold, tough, and stringy.  Obviously, this was unappetizing.\\n\\nI ate about a quarter of my burger, making a huge mess because of the astronomical proportions, before I decided that it just wasn't worth it.

It has a similar, health focused menu and will delight those looking for fresh, organic dining.  Menu selections include healthy pastas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, breakfast, juices and burgers.  \\n\\nI'd highly recommend their bean burger ($7.50).  The burger comes with a black bean patty and caramelized onions on a whole-wheat bun.  This wasn't your typical freezer section black bean patty--it tasted homemade. It was phenomenal.  The bun was also warm and homemade--another win!\\n\\nEach of the burgers come with a salad, fruit or sweet potato fries.  I enjoyed my side salad but the dressing (I think it was some type of vinaigrette) was pretty bland.  I'd prefer more seasoning in the dressing.\\n\\nThe Ahi Ahi tacos were also pretty good but, at $9.50, I wish they came with some type of side.  Three small tacos sitting in the middle of a large plate was less than visually appealing. I felt bad for the tacos, they looked so pathetic and small.  However, the tacos were nicely prepared (although slightly underseasoned) and the tuna was good quality.
