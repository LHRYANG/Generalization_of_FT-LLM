Shortly after starting to use these my son broke out in a horrible rash we have used this diaper before from else where with no issue and even from amazon. Also if your not extremely careful in how you place the diaper the band will cut your child's leg/hip area. Very displeased in these would not recommend buying these. I'm thinking maybe some of these are not really Huggies thrown in with real ones because of the reviews and my own experience. It seems like maybe one in 20 or so is a knock off and if you get them it's horrible I don't plan to risk it again. Furthermore for my son to break out in such a way it worries me of what these diapers contain I hope they don't have some harmful chemical on them. My son does not have sensitive skin and has never broke out like this before",
