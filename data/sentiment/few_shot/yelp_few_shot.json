It looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black pepper.\\nMy wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef.\\n\\n I went to this place because I was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars?!?

It started with a distracted waiter who took forever to take our drinks and meal order.  A table that arrive after us actually had their order taken before ours. It was kind of surreal but with all the great reviews we thought it would be worth the wait. Well, it wasn't! Our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty. The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated. I don't have a steakhouse recommendation for Las Vegas visitors but if you are ever in Chicago and want to taste an excellent aged steak, check out Joes Seafood, Prime Steak &Stone Crab...mmmmmmm!",

Minced Pork - 10.99$ on grubhub, tasted TOTALLY HORRID. Portion was equal to that of a 6$ dish, will not be ordering for delivery again.\\n\\nBased on all the positive reviews, maybe I'll come in to eat... Portion must be bigger than a small round container for 11$\\n\\n\\nP.S.

Recently, thanks to Yelp, I was looking for a sushi place, for lunch with the girl's and came upon Roka Akor.   I saw that they served lunch and that they had a special.  And special it is! Soup, salad and THREE hand rolls.  For such a high end place the price was hugely reasonable.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Think I'm gonna have to go back tomorrow now.",

We stayed in a standard room with two beds and a Strip view. The rooms, including the bathroom, were spacious and clean.\\n\\nWe don't mind walking at all, so we actually enjoyed walking across the street to the Fashion Show Mall and down the street to Las Vegas Boulevard.\\n\\nWe stayed on the 31st floor and we did hear the train in the middle of the night for about 20 seconds. I don't think it was a big deal and probably wouldn't have even noticed it if I didn't read previous reviews.\\n\\nBe aware if you book the room through another website and put occupancy of \\\"\"4\\\"\", you will be given a room with a king and a pullout sofa. There is $25/night fee to have a room with two beds, which we needed. I don't mind paying it, but just disclose the fee (just like the resort fee) before I book so I'm not hit with the charge at the front desk.\\n\\nI would have no hesitation staying here again for the rate we got and would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for something a little different than other hotels directly on Las Vegas Boulevard.",
