It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first. You wouldn't feed your Family Fish Bones. My cats are my Family.  Maybe te product I received was no the usual quality, but it was dry, dry dry. Both the Salmon and Whiting were equally dry.",

When my oldest (male) was younger, he would sit down, stand up, go down, roll over, etc. and do every trick in his repertoire before I even gave him a command whenever I pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti.  My female also loves this but she's a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat.",

We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.",
