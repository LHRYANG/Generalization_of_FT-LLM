In spite of numerous searches, three of 16 victims - known as the Disappeared - have not been found. They are Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Capt Robert Nairac. Mr McVeigh's brother Oliver said the donation was \"great news\". \"Anything that helps the recovery process is very welcome,\" he added. Crimestoppers takes calls anonymously by telephone or accepts information through an anonymous online form. It says any information that it receives will be passed only to the Independent Commission for the Location of the Victims' Remains (ICLVR). The ICLVR was set up to obtain information that may lead to where the bodies of the Disappeared are buried. Information it receives is strictly confidential and is not passed to other agencies or used in prosecutions. 'Help victims' relatives' Fiona McCormack, the director of operations at Crimestoppers, said anonymity would be maintained for those who present new information. \"People giving information can be safe in the knowledge that no-one will ever know who they are - not even us,\" she said. \"That is a promise we have kept since the charity began more than 30 years ago. \"The commission is doing an excellent job and to date the remains of 13 of the 16 Disappeared have been recovered.\" Ms McCormack said the reward was \"not about finding out what happened to these people\" but rather to give victims' relatives the chance to \"hold a long-overdue funeral\". \"The reward was put up by an anonymous donor and is $20,000 (\u00a315,730) for the recovery of each body,\" she added. \"It can only be claimed for information that goes directly to the Crimestoppers charity.\" Geoff Knupfer, the lead investigator for the ICLVR, said his organisation was \"not really interested\" in who the anonymous donor was but he believed the money \"might prove to be a game-changer\". \"We do understand the payment of money for information is a contentious issue at the best of times,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. \"But we have to make it clear that this is a humanitarian process. \"It's nothing to do with crime, it's simply about recovering the remains of the outstanding victims and returning them to their families - it's about closure.\"",

Prosecutors told the city's crown court she was killed by Kathleen Salmond and her boyfriend Kevin Flanagan so they could spend her benefits. The pair deny murder. Ms Salmond denies benefit fraud and preventing a lawful burial - charges Mr Flanagan admits. The court heard how Ms Bennett, a drug and alcohol addict, disappeared after she collected a prescription from a Selly Oak pharmacy on 9 May 2013. \"She was never seen or heard from again by anyone who cared for her,\" prosecutor Simon Denison QC said. The prosecution alleges that Ms Salmond, 40 of Farnhurst Road, Hodge Hill and Flanagan, 39, of Redbrook Covert, Kings Norton, murdered Ms Bennett at their flat in Weoley Castle on or around the day she vanished. Her body was then \"callously disposed of...in the communal bins\" before being incinerated at the council's waste disposal facility, Mr Denison said. Ms Salmond then contacted the Department for Work and Pensions to arrange for Ms Bennett's benefits be paid into her bank account, jurors heard. The couple later told police a man called Ian, who they said was Ms Bennett's boyfriend, arranged to collect the benefits for Ms Bennett each week. \"They were lying... Lisa Bennett was dead and her new boyfriend didn't exist,\" Mr Denison told the court.

December's devastating floods in northern England seem a world away from the Pacific Ocean but anyone embarking on a meteorological whodunit will inevitably have to stop off in the world's largest ocean and investigate further. As well as being exceptionally wet, December 2015 was the UK's warmest December on record. Basic atmospheric physics tells us that warmer air can contain more water vapour and in December this translated into persistent rainfall that drenched the hills of northern England and caused the severe floods that swept downstream. What's causing this? Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office said \"2015 was a record-breaking year for our climate. Global mean temperatures reached 1\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for the first time and the year's average global temperature was the highest ever recorded.\" In the search for the source of this warmth why are meteorologists pointing their fingers towards the Pacific? El Nino. It's the name given to a natural phenomenon, the occasional warming of waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. In 2015 we witnessed this latest El Nino event becoming one of the strongest on record. During El Nino a large expanse of Pacific water becomes warmer than average altering the usual heat exchange pattern with the air above it which goes on to influence weather patterns in a chain reaction around the world. Analysing the reasons for the December floods, the UK Met Office says El Nino contributed to a persistent weather pattern stretching from the Pacific across North America and the Atlantic that resulted in unusually warm, moist air reaching the UK. More than one player As eye-catching as the effects of El Nino have been in the UK and elsewhere, the warming of the Pacific only reached its peak in the second half of 2015 and scientists say attributing all or even the majority of the year's global temperature increase to it would be like giving star billing to an actor who only appears in one scene of a movie. More likely is that natural weather cycles such as El Nino are becoming aligned with man-made heating to boost global temperatures to new heights. Pushing up temperatures The star of the heating show remains emissions from industry and agriculture adding to the greenhouse effect and trapping more of the sun's energy and heat within our atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in the last 800,000 years and reached a record high in May 2015. El Nino's warming influence will be felt well into 2016 so the potential is very much there for this partnership with man-made heating to produce further global temperature headlines this time next year.

The unilateral measures freeze all Venezuelan government assets in the US and ban commercial transactions. They are aimed at piling pressure on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to step down. The US is one of more than 50 nations that do not recognise Mr Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president. What did Michelle Bachelet say? \"I am deeply worried about the potentially severe impact on the human rights of the people of Venezuela of the new set of unilateral sanctions imposed by the US this week,\" the UN human rights commissioner said in a statement. \"The sanctions are extremely broad and fail to contain sufficient measures to mitigate their impact on the most vulnerable sectors of the population.\" Despite some exceptions for sales linked to food, clothing and medicine, she said the measures were \"still likely to significantly exacerbate the crisis for millions of ordinary Venezuelans\". Ms Bachelet has raised concern about the consequences of previous US sanctions against Venezuela. She has also criticised Mr Maduro's government, mainly over its ill-treatment of opponents. In March she singled out Venezuela as an example of how \"violations of civil and political rights\" can accentuate inequality and worsening economic conditions. What were the US measures? On Monday US President Donald Trump signed an executive order stating that \"all property and interests in property of the government of Venezuela that are in the United States... are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in\". The order also bars transactions with Venezuelan authorities whose assets are blocked, stating that \"the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order\". \"The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person,\" is also banned. US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the new sanctions could be imposed on \"anyone who supports\" Mr Maduro's government. The new measures, he added, would force countries and companies to choose between doing business with the US or with Venezuela. He said America would use \"every tool to end Maduro's dictatorship in Venezuela\". Venezuela's foreign ministry denounced the new sanctions and accused Washington of \"arbitrary economic terrorism against the Venezuelan people\". What's the background? The US, along with more than 50 other nations, has given its backing to the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself interim president in January, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election last year was fraudulent. Mr Guaid\u00f3 welcomed the new US sanctions arguing that they punish those \"who do business with the regime\". But international pressure has so far failed to remove Mr Maduro from power.

His comments come months after a high-profile case sparked debate. A court exonerated a teenager executed 18 years ago for rape and murder. Another man has since been convicted and sentenced to death for the crime. \"With regard to miscarriages of justice, we deeply reprove ourselves and demand that courts at all levels draw profound lessons, and further strengthen the effective prevention of unjust and false cases and timely correction mechanisms,\" the chief justice said. He said courts reheard 1,317 cases in 2014 and corrected \"a number of wrongful ones\", according to Xinhua news agency. Analysis, Celia Hatton, Beijing Like many senior officials in China, China's top judge is vowing to improve. The courts will work to hand out the right punishments to the guilty, while allowing the innocent to go free. If Chief Justice Zhou Qiang can follow through on this promise, everyone in China would surely benefit from the changes. Petitioners would be able to exhale, knowing their cases would be heard by an independent court. The indiscriminate power of the Chinese police and government prosecutors would certainly be lessened if China's weakest could rely on the law in the same manner as the elite. However, there are reasons to doubt Mr Zhou's words. The structure of the government hasn't changed; the ruling Communist Party remains in charge of the courts. By next year, China might have improved the statistics regarding its 99% conviction rate. However, until there is proof that the courts have the power and the courage to rule against ingrained government interests, true judicial reform remains a distant goal. China's courts have a very high conviction rate - in 2013, it stood at 99.9%, according to the top court. Rights groups highlight political control over courts, judicial corruption, the use of force by police to extract confessions and inadequate access by defendants to lawyers as factors in this. In one potential step forward, in January the Communist Party said targets for arrests and convictions would be abolished, according to a report carried by Xinhua news agency.

Xinhua reported that Huugjilt had tried to help save the woman after hearing her cry out from a public toilet. He reported the crime to police - but was then put on trial for it. In 2005 serial rapist and murderer Zhai Zhihong confessed to police that he had attacked the woman. There have been other well-reported cases. In May 2010 a man jailed for murder was freed when his supposed victim reappeared. He said police beat a confession out of him.",

However, it also generated criticism online, with some arguing that it wasted resources and was located at an inappropriate location. Henan province was the centre of a famine in the 1950s resulting from Mao's policies. Millions of people died in the famine, triggered by a campaign known as the Great Leap Forward. Despite being responsible for so many deaths, Mao Zedong is revered by many in China, not least by President Xi Jinping, who praises him as a \"great figure\".

The presidential office confirmed it bought 364 Viagra and similar generic pills to deal with altitude sickness on official trips to East Africa, although the pills were never used. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul, says the discovery of Viagra will add an air of remoteness to the president. Many Koreans believe Ms Park is living in a \"different world\" which will exacerbate political pressure on her to resign. Some early rumours among Koreans alleged Ms Park could have been involved with cultish rituals with her friend Ms Choi. Ms Choi, a long-time friend of Ms Park's, is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a shadowy quasi-religious leader who was closely linked to Ms Park's father, then-president Park Chung-hee.

The discovery of Viagra grew out of the drug UK92480, a new treatment for angina, a heart condition that constricts the vessels that supply the heart with blood. It failed in treating angina, but during drug trials many volunteers reported an unusual side effect - lots of erections. Scientists ran more tests and discovered its effectiveness at treating erectile dysfunction. Because of biological similarities between the lungs and penis, scientists also discovered it could help protect against pulmonary hypertension, common in climbers. At high altitudes decreased levels of oxygen can trigger high blood pressure in the lungs, which in extreme circumstance can be fatal. Viagra reduces high blood pressure and improves the transport of oxygen in the blood. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have raided the offices of Samsung and the national pension fund as part of a corruption investigation linked to the president. They are probing whether Ms Park pressured the fund to support a Samsung merger, said the Yonhap news agency. Samsung's offices had already been raided over related allegations. Wednesday's raid had to do with a merger last year between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries.

MSPs heard that some neighbours had been removing alternate plants so that they were no longer classed as a hedge. The committee convenor said the law was not working in the spirit in which it was intended. The High Hedges (Scotland) Act came into force in 2014 to resolve neighbourhood rows over hedges which grow more than two metres tall and block out light. The committee said people often tried to avoid action by disputing whether their plants should properly be categorised as a hedge. But local authority representatives also raised concern that widening the definition might lead to the removal of trees. 'Non-hedge' Committee convener Bob Doris said: \"Our committee heard directly from homeowners across Scotland, and many of them spoke of the serious impact high hedges had on their quality of life. \"Some even said they felt they were forced to live in the shadows because of hedges blocking natural light to their homes. Quite clearly, if someone's life is made a misery from blocked-out light, this must be addressed. \"While there are examples of the High Hedges Act working well for communities, it's clear that it's not currently operating in the full spirit, as was intended. \"For example, we found that some local authorities dismissed applications as they deemed a row of trees or shrubs to be a 'non-hedge' despite the detrimental impact on homeowners.\" The committee made several recommendations aimed at improving the legislation, including clarifying \"what is and what is not a high hedge\".

Jackson died from an overdose of the powerful anaesthetic propofol while preparing for 50 comeback gigs in the UK. The legal action claims AEG Live is liable for his death because Dr Murray supplied Jackson with the surgical drug. 'Preposterous' The Jackson family is suing for $40bn (\u00a326bn). But AEG Live has said it was not responsible for the hire or supervision of the doctor and called the $40bn claim \"preposterous\". Potential witnesses include Jackson's mother, his two oldest children, Prince, 16, and Paris, 15, as well as the singers Prince and Diana Ross. The jury was selected from more than 100 candidates - many of whom were eliminated because they said serving on a three-month trial would be a hardship. Others were rejected when they said they had a bias against Jackson or disapproved of big-figure legal cases or had business ties to AEG or the Jackson family. Alternative jurors Lawyers for both sides have now begun questioning prospective candidates to sit as six alternative jurors - used to replace a regular juror who becomes unable to serve. The legal action accuses the promoters of failing to check the credentials of Dr Murray, who supplied Jackson with the propofol. During Dr Murray's trial in 2011, the prosecution said he caused the star's death through negligence.

The legislation containing the offer had been delayed over its description of Gibraltar as a \"colony\". The European Parliament approved the law on Thursday, meaning it will come into effect once EU states have given it the final sign-off. The final draft includes the description of Gibraltar as a \"colony of the British Crown\" in a footnote. It was backed by a parliamentary committee on Wednesday, after the British MEP piloting its passage through the assembly was replaced. Labour's Claude Moraes had criticised the description, calling it \"opportunistic\" and \"unnecessary\". He said he had been looking for a compromise over replacing the description but had been forced out of the role after \"bullying\" from EU states. His replacement, Bulgarian MEP Sergei Stanishev, also criticised EU states' insistence on the term, which he described as \"irresponsible\". But he said the European Parliament also wanted to avoid the need to re-introduce visas, which he said would cause \"chaos\" for British and EU citizens. The new legislation would come into effect immediately following a no-deal Brexit, or after the planned transition period if there is a deal. It would allow trips to the EU and four countries in the passport-free Schengen area for up to three months within any six-month period. It would mean the UK would join a list of around 60 countries whose nationals do not require a visa for short stays in the EU. However Britons will still need to pay \u20ac7 (\u00a36.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, because of a new security system for Schengen zone countries.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accepted all 29 recommendations contained in the report. The 11 September attack saw Ambassador Christopher Stevens, as well as three other US officials, killed. The ambassador died of smoke inhalation when he was trapped alone in the burning consulate building, after armed men had stormed the compound. The assault triggered a major political row over who knew what and when. As a result, an independent panel - the Accountability Review Board- was charged with investigating the incident. The report identified the state department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near East Affairs for criticism over their apparent lack of cooperation and ensuing confusion with regards to protection. \"Systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,\" the panel concluded. However, the review has not suggested disciplinary action be taken against any individuals. 'Profoundly lacking' Despite \"a lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership\" among certain senior state department officials, the report found no \"reasonable cause\" that any specific individuals had \"engaged in misconduct or wilfully ignored\" their responsibilities. It also said there had been \"no immediate, specific\" intelligence about the 11 September attack or threats to the consulate. In a letter to congressional committees, Mrs Clinton said she had ordered the state department to implement the investigation's findings \"quickly and completely\". She outlined some steps the agency would take, including sending hundreds of Marine guards to US missions abroad and assigning a state department official to oversee \"high threat posts\". In addition, Mrs Clinton said the state department would request more funding from Congress to make improvements to security. The probe concluded that the US personnel had \"performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near-impossible situation\". But the Benghazi mission had nevertheless been hampered by a lack of resources. The reliance on armed \"but poorly skilled\" local militiamen and contract guards was \"misplaced,\" the report said. \"The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs which constitute a small percentage of the full national budget and that spent for national security,\" according to the review. The probe also criticised the Libyan government's response to the attack, characterising it as \"profoundly lacking\". The Obama administration's handling of the attack in Benghazi has become the focus of Republican criticism. Officials initially said the attack had developed out of protests against an anti-Muslim video. But later intelligence reports suggested it was possibly tied to al-Qaeda affiliates.",

It stresses that it is not an attempt to change the party leadership too. Campaign leaders think the best way to get a new referendum is to get the main opposition party to back it officially. At the weekend, the People's Vote commissioned polling which suggested voters targeted by Labour were more likely to back a referendum - and to favour remaining in the EU - than the electorate as a whole. It hopes that this might encourage a change in approach by the party's leadership. The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, and not to call for a new one but to \"leave all options on the table\" if a deal is not agreed by Parliament. Those options would include a new election, and what shadow chancellor John McDonnell calls \"democratic engagement\", which might mean a further referendum if there is deadlock. The People's Vote campaign believes a general election is unlikely so is pushing to get the issue of a referendum debated at next month's Labour conference. This is not guaranteed as the conference as a whole would need to decide that this would be a priority for debate. Even if it clears this hurdle, some left-wing members of the party - who usually back Jeremy Corbyn - would need to offer their support, for any motion on Brexit to be successful, With this need to appeal to Corbyn supporters in mind, the internal memo to members of the People's Vote campaign does explicitly state that any change in Labour policy to support a new referendum should not be used to undermine or damage the party leadership. Many of the more prominent Labour politicians associated with the campaign have been critics of Jeremy Corbyn. So the memo - drafted by Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader - urges supporters to make clear that the People's vote should not be seen as a \"nascent\" centre party, a fear of some on the left. It emphasises that \"whatever views supporters have about the overall direction of the Labour Party, the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally\" and that the tone the campaign takes will be crucial to its success. With the left-wing group Momentum about to consult its members on Brexit, the People's Vote is hopeful that Labour's policy could change before Parliament votes on the final deal.",

Activities include \"engineering in movies\" as well as the opportunity to meet businesses to discuss apprenticeship and job opportunities. The RAE said it was keen to build on the region's \"long history of engineering\" and support the untapped engineering potential within students from the area. It added it wanted to build a skills base to support many of the new engineering companies investing in south Wales. The project will provide free STEM \"enhancement and enrichment opportunities\" to eight secondary schools and five primary schools to \"create an engineering ethos\". The RAE will also work with colleges, businesses and the government. It has previously run similar engineering education projects in Barrow-in-Furness, Stoke-on-Trent, and Lowestoft in Suffolk. The Barrow-in-Furness project has been a \"huge success\", according to the organisation. Since 2008, it has helped provide more than 56,000 STEM \"engagement opportunities\" for students in the area.

However, he avoided arrest and was said to have carried on working as a doctor. Domestic and international pressure apparently prompted Fadl to surrender, campaign group Equality Now said. FGM was banned in Egypt in 2008 but the country still has one of the highest rates of the practice in the world. More than 90% of girls and women aged between 15 and 59 in the country have undergone the procedure in recent years, according to UN estimates. Suad Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East and North Africa Consultant for Equality Now, said Egypt must adopt a \"zero tolerance policy\" towards FGM, which includes taking swift action against the health workers who carry it out. Unless this is done, she said, \"Egyptian girls will continue to face this extreme human rights abuse\". Fadl was convicted in January 2015 over the death of al-Bataa, who was from a small farming community on the outskirts of the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. He was sentenced to two years in prison for manslaughter, as well as a further three months for performing FGM. However, he reportedly reached a deal with the girl's family that means he will no longer have to serve the manslaughter sentence - and is only liable for the three-month term for FGM. During the trial, prosecutors argued that al-Bataa had been forced to undergo FGM by her father. Fadl denied carrying out the procedure, saying he had only treated her for warts and that her death had been caused by an allergic reaction to penicillin. Both he and Suhair's father were cleared of any wrongdoing at an initial trial. But prosecutors appealed against the verdict and it was overturned in November 2015. Fadl's clinic was ordered to close for a year. Suhair's father was meanwhile given a three-month suspended sentence. However, Fadl continued practising intermittently after the conviction, according to Equality Now and a partner agency, the Center for Egyptian Women's Legal Assistance (CEWLA). Following further pressure, his medical license was revoked earlier this year.

More than 11,600 people have died from coronavirus in care homes across the UK during the pandemic, figures suggest.

It also said it would be \"valuable to test in selected homes\" that appear to be free of the virus, to find out if anyone has been infected without displaying symptoms. Ministers have since promised that swabs will be available for residents and staff at all homes.

He was sworn in as president last week, succeeding his mentor Hugo Chavez, who died in March of cancer.

Nine people died in post-election protests and both the government and opposition are planning more protests on 1 May.

Dr Clive Edmonds, who is assessing the area, said the cul-de-sac sits on top of a former brickyard. He said a slump in the chalk, clay and waste sand under the ground could have been triggered by the recent rainfall. The hole, which is being filled in with concrete, led to a number of homes being evacuated early on Saturday and 11 are still unsafe to return to. Many other homes still have no gas or electric. Police said the hole stretched about 6ft (1.8m) under one house and reached the centre of the road on the other side. Dr Edmonds, who has studied subsistence for 25 years, said it could take several months to establish an exact cause but he believed it was likely to be a crown hole, which is governed by man-made factors, rather than a sinkhole which is formed naturally. He said the area was the site of a brickyard during the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, and to make bricks and tiles a mixture of clay and chalk was dug out of the ground. Waste sand deposits were then placed back into the ground to fill the voids. \"There is a high likelihood that it is mining-related. Fortunately they're pretty rare events - certainly of this scale,\" said Dr Edmonds. A spokeswoman for Hightown Praetorian and Churches Housing Association, which owns the homes on Oatridge Gardens, said tests on the ground would take place in the next week, which will then determine what further work is required before residents can move back in. All people evacuated from their homes have been provided with temporary accommodation, she added.

Mr Haw's long-standing presence on the pavement on the east side of Parliament Square is not threatened by the order. He set up his camp in 2001 in Parliament Square Gardens. Parliament Square Gardens is owned by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while the pavement surrounding the square belongs to Westminster Council. Mr Haw, previously from Redditch, Worcestershire, has a tent on the grass area in the square. He is currently undergoing treatment for lung cancer in Germany.

A spokesperson for the mayor said: \"The mayor is pleased that the High Court has supported previous rulings to return possession of Parliament Square Gardens to the GLA. \"The Court of Appeal had previously made a special case for Brian Haw and Barbara Tucker that they could continue to sleep on the grass area controlled by the GLA on a temporary basis while their case was referred back to the High Court for conclusion in this matter. \"The High Court has now concluded that neither party should be allowed to continue to sleep on the GLA controlled grass. The perimeter fences will be adjusted accordingly.\" Mrs Tucker had asked the appeal judges to adjourn the application to give more time to Mr Haw to prepare the case for health reasons. But Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger and Lady Justice Smith rejected the application and ruled there was \"no prospect\" of any appeal being successful as the mayor of London was entitled to his order for possession without any further delay as \"justice delayed is justice denied\". 'A cover-up' Mrs Tucker said that if the eviction order was enforced the veteran campaigner would have to sleep on the pavement.

The defendants denied the claims. In May it was revealed that 126 births were incorrectly registered by the adoption agency between 1946 and 1969. Following lengthy talks between the sides, barrister Eanna Mulloy, for Ms Reeves and Mr Farrell, told the high court in Dublin that the parties had reached \"a comprehensive agreement\". Mr Justice Denis McDonald said he was \"really delighted\" the case had been resolved. The terms of the settlement are confidential. Mrs Reeves gave birth to Mr Farrell at a clinic in Dublin on 13 March 1961. Days later he was placed with a family at Liscolman, Tullow, County Carlow and given the name Patrick Farrell by the now deceased couple Jim and Maeve Farrell. Mrs Reeves spent decades looking for him and they were reunited in 2013. Mr Farrell did not know he was adopted until late in 2012, months after his adoptive mother's death. Mrs Reeves, who is now living in Cornwall in England, claimed she was given the \"brush off\" by St Patrick's Guild and others in authority when she sought to make contact with him. The court heard Mrs Reeves, who came from a catholic English family with Irish connections, was sent to Ireland after she became pregnant in 1960. She gave birth to her son at the Marie clinic in Dublin in March 1961 and called him Andre, on the basis he would be the only Andre in Ireland in the hope of someday finding him. During her long search, she claimed she was told by a nun that adopted children do not look for their birth parents and that he had been likely sent to America. She learned in 1997 that he had been placed with an Irish family, but despite her requests was not given information that would allow her to make contact him. Mr Farrell was only made aware of his true origins in 2012. 'Alleged failure to protect family rights' Both Mr Farrell, 57, and Mrs Reeves, 79, said his adoption was unlawful and claimed his placement with the Farrells was done without the legal safeguards provided under the adoption laws. They claimed false birth and baptism certificates were procured in respect of baby Andre. They sought damages for alleged false misrepresentations made concerning Patrick's location. They also alleged Saint Patrick's Guild engaged in a conspiracy and failed to provide them with information about each other in a timely manner. They claimed there was a failure to protect their family rights and that Patrick was placed with the Farrells without their suitability being assessed. They also alleged the Irish State failed to vindicate or recognise the rights of the mother and son. All claims were denied.",

David Davis has previously ruled out EEA/Efta membership, calling them in \"in many ways, the worst of all outcomes\". He told MPs in September the government had considered them as an option during the transition period but decided it would be \"more complicated, more difficult and less beneficial\" than designing a bespoke arrangement. Mr Benn said the government had ruled out things before but had to \"face reality\" and accept them during Brexit negotiations.

So far that it's the most successful exhibition ever in McManus, the most successful exhibition ever Dundee and the most successful comics exhibition in the UK ever. \"We have already whizzed past the 80,000 visitor mark, now before 21 October we are dreaming of making the ton. \"To do that, not only have we uncovered this wonderful piece of art but we are further incentivising things by saying that, if you take a selfie alongside the Minnie Lisa and hashtag 'McMenace' on your social media, one of the people is going to be immortalised as a Beano character.\" The current visitor figures beat the previous highest total for a comic exhibition in the UK, 54,324 for Comics Unmasked at the British Library in 2014. Visitor numbers also exceeded other exhibitions held at the McManus such as Ten Drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Titian's Diana. Carly Cooper, curator of social history at McManus said: \"We hope the people who have come in to see the museum will come in again to see this new piece that has been unveiled. \"We have been absolutely amazed with the exhibition, it has been fantastic, it has been the biggest visitor figures in a while, probably more than we expected, it has been our summer blockbuster. \"To everyone who hasn't been, we encourage you to come in before it is all taken down.\"",

The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered it to pay \u00a393,000 to the directors of now-defunct 2Travel. Cardiff Bus finance and admin director Cynthia Ogbonna is made interim MD. Mr Brown resigned on Friday after 18 years with the firm after the tribunal accused him of lying as part of \"outrageous\" behaviour by the bus firm to \"exclude\" a rival outfit. The tribunal, headed by former MP and ex-Welsh Lib Dem leader Lord Carlile of Berriew, found Cardiff Bus \"abused its dominant position\" when it set up a no-frills alternative to 2Travel. It rejected much of Mr Brown's evidence about the introduction of the firm's White Service as \"untrue\". It found the firm put up \"a deliberate smoke-screen\" about why it had brought in the new service in 2004. The report said: \"They were, not to put too fine a point on it, lies. From this conclusion follows the clear inference that Cardiff Bus knew that it was doing something illegal.\" The tribunal found Mr Brown and the former MD, Alan Kreppel, were in on the scheme \"from the beginning\". The directors of 2Travel had asked for \u00a320m compensation but the tribunal rejected its claim for a \"loss of a commercial opportunity\". 'Well respected' It ordered Cardiff Bus to pay the 2Travel \u00a333,818.79 for loss of profits and \u00a360,000 in exemplary damages. Following the appointment of Ms Ogbonna, Cardiff Bus company chairman, Cardiff councillor Joseph Carter, said the board were working to recruit a permanent managing director.

The report from the US-based group was based on interviews with 203 Tibetan refugees outside China. China has blamed Tibetan \"separatists\" for inciting the violence and denies that excessive force was used. The unrest in March 2008 was the worst in Tibet for 20 years. Violence erupted in Lhasa on 14 March, shortly after the anniversary of a failed revolt against China in 1959. China says rioters killed at least 19 people, most of them Han Chinese, but Tibetan exiles say security forces killed dozens of protesters. The violence then spread to ethnic Tibetan areas outside Tibet. In the wake of the unrest Tibet was closed to foreigners and tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers sent to the region. 'Indiscriminate shooting' In its report, Human Rights Watch cited four occasions in which security forces open fired on demonstrators - in Lhasa on 14 March, and in three ethnic Tibetan areas in Sichuan province in the days that followed the Lhasa unrest. The group also included testimony from protesters in Lhasa and elsewhere who said they saw people being beaten with electric batons and rifle butts, or kicked by police. Tibetan protester Pema Lhakyi told the group she was near Barkor Square in Lhasa on 14 March. \"The soldiers did not come until afternoon that day. We could shout and protest as much as we wanted. It felt good,\" she said. \"When the soldiers showed up later, they threw tear gas. A gas canister hit my leg and I couldn't walk any more. Then there was indiscriminate shooting and we saw two people shot dead in front of us.\" Sophie Richardson, HRW's Asia advocacy director, said that testimony from dozens of eyewitnesses showed \"the official willingness to use lethal force against unarmed protesters\". \"This report decisively refutes the Chinese government's claim that it handled the protests in line with international standards and domestic laws,\" she said. Those who were arrested said they were beaten with clubs and sticks, held in cells so crowded they could not sit down and deprived of food. Some said they had been told to admit they had been paid to protest by the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. HRW said it had condemned violence committed by Tibetans as well as by security personnel. But it called for an international investigation into the events of March 2008 and for Tibet to be opened to international media and monitors. Responding to the report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang accused Human Rights Watch of bias. He described the unrest in Lhasa as \"serious, violent criminal incidents that caused great loss to the lives and property of the local people\", and said law had been enforced in a legal way.",

M&S's chief executive Marc Bolland told me he was advised by the company's lawyers, public relations advisers and brokers that he had to put out the rest of the three-month figures, because otherwise he would have been unable to respond to overnight media enquiries . But markets are not open tonight and it is unusual for a business to react to a leak in this way. In 30 years of keeping an eye on the stock market, I don't recall anything quite like it. Some may argue the incident shows M&S senior directors no longer have the confidence to do their own thing and face down the outside world in the way that was characteristic of the company for many decades. As for the numbers themselves, the poor clothing sales had been widely anticipated - and new managers of that part of M&S were brought in towards the end of the year. By contrast M&S Christmas food sales were pretty good, and the profitability of sales in general - or profit margins - improved. So these numbers are unlikely to shock investors, they don't represent a profit warning, even if the early release of the figures is a bit of a surprise. Update 09.15, 10 January 2013 It is a tale of two retailing giants, giant ships passing in the night. Tesco may be sailing into calmer waters, with signs that its expensive rehabilitation of UK stores may be paying off: it has reported a 1.8% increase in like-for-like or underlying sales, its best performance for three years. And its shares are up 2.8%. So critics of its chief executive, Philip Clarke, will keep quiet, for now at least - though they will want to see a sustained recovery before becoming convinced he should be at the helm for the duration. Clarke clearly feels more relaxed about what is going on in the core British operation, given that he has handed over the national levers to a new UK MD. As for M&S, investors seem unimpressed both by its lousy UK clothing and general merchandise performance, and by the spectacle of management mayhem in the form of the premature release last night of its trading figures. Last time I looked, M&S's shares were down more than 4.5%. Those investors querying whether Marc Bolland is the right CEO for these challenging times will not be reassured.",

Biogas produced will be sent to Northern Ireland to help heat and power factories owned by manufacturing companies Bombardier and Montupet. The Northern Ireland Executive loan covers 40% of the \u00a323m capital cost. The by-product from the process, called digestate, will be spread in forestry and on land near the plant. The agri-food industry said the absence of a long-term solution to the poultry waste problem threatened \"the sector's viability\". About 6,000 people work in the poultry meat sector in Northern Ireland and it is a major contributor to the economy. But finding a solution to the 270,000 tonnes of waste it produces a year has been a headache. Some of it is spread as fertiliser on fields, but it is high in phosphorous and Northern Ireland already has phosphorous-rich soils. That means there is a danger that additional land spreading could lead to excess phosphorous running off into rivers or lakes and causing damage. The European Union has rules against that, which Northern Ireland must comply with. That is why the treatment plant is being built in the Republic of Ireland. The soil where the digestate will be spread has lower levels of phosphorous and can cope with the additional nutrients. The plant at Ballybofey already has planning permission and is licensed by the Republic of Ireland's Environmental Protection Agency. Built by Williams Industrial Services, specialists from Mallusk in County Antrim, it is expected to be operational by March 2017. It is one of a number of anaerobic digesters expected to be built to take poultry litter.

Her widower Ernest Boateng told the inquest that \"due to high demand at the hospital she had to continue working\". A senior colleague said she had no knowledge of Ms Agyapong being pressured to return or remain at work. The inquest in Bedfordshire heard Ms Agyapong was signed off on 12 March 2020, initially for back problems, and died on 12 April. She was admitted to hospital with breathing problems on 5 April and discharged the same day. Dr William Manning, who assessed the nurse on her admission, said he \"suspected she had Covid-19\" but sent her home as she did not require oxygen therapy. \"She didn't seem particularly happy to go home,\" he said. Two days later she was readmitted with Covid symptoms. Surgeons safely delivered her baby, also named Mary, by Caesarean section before Ms Agyapong was transferred to intensive care, where she died. Her preliminary cause of death was given as pneumonia and Covid-19. Giving evidence, Mr Boateng said: \"Mary continued to work during this time [the start of the coronavirus outbreak], but she was very concerned about the situation involving Covid-19, so much so that when she came home from work she would take her clothes off at the front door and take a shower immediately. \"She was very worried about bringing Covid into the home.\" Mr Boateng told the inquest his wife had worked \"on some Covid-19 wards\". \"I wanted her to stay at home,\" said Mr Boateng. \"But due to high demand at the hospital, she had to continue working. \"She tried to reassure me that everything would be OK but I could understand she was anxious and panicking deep down.\" Mr Boateng said he strongly believed his wife contracted Covid while at work. The inquest heard that after she was signed off, Ms Agyapong would go into the hospital to confirm her ill-health and to attend medical appointments. \"My understanding is Mary was being pressurised to get back to work, as she had meetings about her sickness records earlier that year,\" Mr Boateng said. Jonathan Holl-Allen QC, for Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, asked Nicola Hinselwood, a senior colleague of Ms Agyapong's, if there was \"any question of Mary being pressured either to return to work or to remain at work\". Ms Hinselwood replied: \"Not to my knowledge.\" Mr Boateng told the inquest he was not allowed on to the maternity ward to be with his wife when she gave birth on 7 April. \"What was supposed to be a happy moment in our lives quickly changed into a traumatic and painful loss,\" he said. \"Every day my children have to deal with the loss of their mother and I feel helpless when AJ asks when he can see his mother again.\" The inquest continues.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) added that exports rose 10.3% to 1.35 million vehicles, a record for the second consecutive year. But SMMT head Mike Hawes repeated fears that investment would suffer without a suitable post-Brexit EU trade deal. Mr Hawes said that car production was on course to reach an all-time high before 2020. But the SMMT's statement sounded a note of caution after revealing that investment by the industry fell to \u00a31.66bn last year, compared with about \u00a32.5bn in recent years. On Tuesday, Mr Hawes told MPs on the Treasury Committee that many carmakers are putting off investment until there is more clarity over the UK's trade relations with the EU. 'Red line' Mr Hawes said: \"Significant investment in new plants and products over the past few years has driven this growth, not a post-Brexit bounce. \"We want trade deals but they must be the right deals, not rushed deals. Failure to do so could damage UK automotive manufacturing beyond repair.\" The imposition of tariffs would be \"a red line for the industry,\" he said. \"There would be an impact on demand and jobs - that's a cliff edge we want to avoid.\" However, Business Secretary Greg Clark insisted the car industry would thrive, saying: \"Our modern industrial strategy will make the UK one of the most competitive places in the world to grow a business and these figures show why the UK automotive sector has such a vital role to play as we build on our strengths and extend excellence into the future.\" US growth UK car exports to EU countries increased by 7.5% to 758,680 last year, accounting for half of all exports, the SMMT said. There was also a big rise in car exports to the US, where demand jumped by almost half, accounting for around 14% of all UK car exports. Increases were also seen in Turkey, Japan and Canada, with a modest 3% rise in China, the SMMT reported. The UK has 15 car plants, directly employing 169,000 workers and 814,000 across the sector.

Police said no arrests have been made. If confirmed, it is believed to be the first incident of its kind in the UK. A British Airways spokesman said: \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight.\" The airline will give the police \"every assistance with their investigation\", the spokesman added. A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesman said it was \"totally unacceptable\" to fly drones close to airports, and anyone flouting the rules can face \"severe penalties, including imprisonment\". Steve Landells, from the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said it had been \"only a matter of time before we had a drone strike\". He called for greater enforcement of existing rules. Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? Drones pose 'real threat' to civil aviation Analysis Leo Kelion, Technology editor Flying a drone near an airport can already be punished with up to five years in prison, and rules also forbid taking them above 400ft (122m) or near buildings and crowds of people. But the latest incident will only add to the pressure for further steps to be taken. The US recently introduced a compulsory registration scheme so any drone recovered from an accident can be traced back to its owner. In addition, officials could make it mandatory for drones to run geo-fencing software - that would prevent them flying in restricted areas. The Department for Transport has promised to publish a strategy for unmanned aircraft this year. And pilots have also called for the DoT to fund tests into what would happen if a drone got sucked into an engine or crashed into a plane's windscreen. Last month, the British Airline Pilots Association noted that while the threat of bird strikes had been well researched there was little data about how much damage a drone could cause a plane. 'Severe penalties' The incident follows a warning earlier this year by the head of the International Air Transport Association that drones flown by the general public are \"a real and growing threat\" to civilian aircraft. Tony Tyler called for drone regulations to be put in place before any serious accidents occur. The UK Air Proximity Board - which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace - said there have been a number of serious near-misses at UK airports involving drones.

Both men then are said to have taken Mr Brugiatelli's rucksack, and demanded their money back and a gram of cocaine in exchange. At this point, Mr Brugiatelli allegedly rang the police.

Police said they later found the weapon hidden behind a false panel in the US students' hotel room. Mr Elder has admitted stabbing the officer. But both he and Mr Natale-Hjorth stand accused of murdering Rega, and are also facing extortion charges. How has the case been handled? There have been a number of questions raised about the case in both the Italian and US media. A leaked photo showing Mr Natale-Hjorth blindfolded and restrained at a police station appeared in the press shortly after their arrest. Rega's partner Mr Varriale later said he had filmed Mr Natale-Hjorth's interrogation on his phone, which is where the photo came from. The police officer said he and Rega identified themselves on the night. But the US students say they saw no evidence they were police. And Mr Varriale also faced a \"dereliction of duty\" charge for not carrying his weapon on the night. Neither he nor Rega were armed, which is against procedure. Defence lawyers for the US students have also raised questions about the case. Talks between Mr Elder and his lawyer appeared in the Italian media which suggested he had confessed. But the defence said the transcripts were badly translated and seemed to omit parts of their conversation. Some in the US have even compared the case to that of Amanda Knox. The US student served four years in prison for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Italy's top appeals court overturned her conviction in 2015.",

Senator Le Gresley's comments were made as the States unveiled the latest three-yearly review of the social security fund conducted by the UK Government Actuary's Department, which assesses public sector financial risk. The report suggests social security contributions may need to rise by up to 40% by 2042. It also suggests more immigration could limit the need to raise tax by increasing the number of taxpayers. Senator Le Gresley said some of the \u00a31bn fund, worth five times current annual welfare spending, could be used to smooth tax rises.

Work offshore is due to commence in late 2017, with the project scheduled to generate its first power in 2018. Vattenfall said the offshore wind test and demonstration facility would be the largest of its kind in Scotland. However, representatives of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has battled unsuccessfully in the courts to halt the project, said they would continue their challenge to the planning process. In a statement, the Trump Organisation said: \"There are 16 planning conditions which have not been purified and we intend to lodge formal written objections with Marine Scotland, challenging each one of them. \"The project can't proceed until the conditions are satisfied and we will also pursue additional remedies before the European Courts as necessary.\" Mr Trump has argued that the wind farm, near Blackdog, would spoil the view from his golf resort at the Menie estate on the Aberdeenshire coast. 'Robust project' Vattenfall said it was confident the project would go ahead as planned, despite uncertainty over whether it will still receive a 40 million euro grant from the European Union, following the Brexit vote. Project director Adam Ezzamel told BBC Scotland it was \"a bit early\" to say what the impact of the vote might be on funding. He said: \"We will be engaging with the EU, as is normal practice for us, and time will tell what that means for the project. \"But we have a very robust project, we are world leaders in the construction of offshore wind farms and whichever way that goes, I am confident that we can address that and make the project happen.\" Vattenfall has taken up full ownership of the project, having bought Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group's 25% share for an undisclosed amount. Responding to the Vattenfall announcement, Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: \"This is great news for the industry. Scotland is admired around the world for our work in renewable energy. \"This project will keep our nation at the forefront of innovation by allowing energy companies to identify new ways to reduce operating costs.\" The Scottish Greens said it was \"welcome news\".

Mental health charities have criticised the series for showing the character's suicide on screen and accused producers of glorifying the act. New Zealand has the highest rate of teen suicide in the developed world and says that's why it introduced a new rating for 13 Reasons Why. \"The most immediate concern for the Classification Office is how teen suicide is discussed and shown in 13 Reasons Why,\" reads a post by the Office of Film & Literature Classification. \"Hannah's suicide is presented fatalistically. Her death is represented at times as not only a logical, but an unavoidable outcome of the events that follow. \"Suicide should not be presented to anyone as being the result of clear headed thinking. \"Suicide is preventable, and most people who experience suicidal thoughts are not thinking rationally and therefore cannot make logical decisions.\" 13 Reasons Why is rated 18 in the UK, which the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) states is due to sexual violence, strong bloody images and the suicide scene. \"The BBFC regularly consults with experts, including Samaritans, to help ensure that our classification policies and decisions in relation to challenging content are aligned with expert advice,\" Murray Perkins, compliance manager at the BBFC, tells Newsbeat. \"Consequently, the BBFC operates a strict policy when it comes to depictions of lesser known techniques of suicide, for example. \"After careful consideration, the BBFC classified 13 Reasons Why 18 meaning that we do not consider the series as a whole to be suitable for those who are not adults.\" Netflix also says it took precautions when making the show. \"We knew the material covered sensitive topics, as the book did when it was published in 2007, and we worked with mental health experts to show how these issues impact teens in real and dramatic ways,\" says a statement from Netflix given to Newsbeat. The US company claims it brought in several measures to address the controversial content in 13 Reasons Why. \"We gave the series an 18 rating, added explicit warnings on the three most graphic episodes, produced an after show, Beyond the Reasons, that delves deeper into some of the tougher topics portrayed, as well as created a global website to help people find local mental health resources.\" 13 Reasons Why is the most tweeted about TV show of 2017, with 11 million mentions on Twitter since its debut in March.

Drinks are teenagers' main source of added sugar, and too much can lead to obesity and health problems. In March, the government promised a tax on sugary drinks in England. A five-year-old should have no more than 19g of sugar in a day, a 10-year-old no more than 24g, and teenagers and adults no more than 30g. A typical can of cola contains 35g (nine teaspoons). The survey data suggests: When the sugar tax comes in, soft drinks companies will pay a charge for drinks with added sugar and a total sugar content of 5g or more per 100ml (about 5%). But drinks with a high milk content will be exempt because milk contains calcium and other nutrients the government says are \"vital for a healthy diet\". Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: \"The sugar levy is a good way to help cut intakes, but children get sugar from many sources. \"We're also working with businesses and retailers to gradually take sugar out of the food children eat the most, so we can cut sugar intakes across the whole diet, not just drinks.\" The British Soft Drinks Association said: \"Teenagers' sugar intake from soft drinks is down by 8%. \"This is not surprising since soft drinks companies' action on reformulation and smaller pack sizes has helped drive a 17% cut in sugar consumed from soft drinks since 2012.\"",

Kim Jong-un, dressed in a dark blue civilian suit, sat next to his father on a viewing platform at Kim Il-sung Plaza as tanks with rocket-propelled grenades and long-range missiles rolled by. The missiles carried the slogan of the Korean People's Army: \"Defeat the US military.

Members of the international media were also invited in to witness the event. As a spotlight shone on the two men, the massive crowd at the Arirang gymnastics and dance festival rose to their feet and burst into applause. Last month, the Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un was made a four-star general and given senior positions in the government and the Workers' Party, at a rare party conference. Analysts say this means he is in line to succeed his father, who took over the leadership of North Korea in 1994 after his father, Kim Il-sung, died.

Kim Jong-il is thought to be in poor health and is widely believed to have suffered a stroke two years ago.

The National Autistic Society has asked the school not to apply the rule to autistic students, like 12-year-old pupil Reese O'Rourke. Reese's mother, Charlene O'Rourke, said her son struggled with making eye contact with people and she would not want him to be forced to do so. She said: \"They [pupils] do need to have discipline, but can't discipline a child with special needs because that is not going to work. It will make my son retaliate.\" Jane Harris, director of external affairs at the National Autistic Society, said the rule could be \"discriminatory and potentially be breaking the law\" because keeping eye contact can be \"physically painful\" for some autistic people. Mr Smith defended the school's behaviour rules, and said: \"We take support for children with special education needs very seriously, and one of the reasons for our strict approach on behaviour is to ensure we have calm classrooms that allow as many pupils as possible to take part in mainstream lessons with their peers. \"Even in these first few days we have children thriving in classes who previously couldn't cope with the noise and behaviour they faced.\"",

He said the Japanese firm was preparing for a no-deal outcome but had not discussed relocating its Swindon plant. The firm builds its Civic model in Britain for the global market. In an interview with Radio 5 live, Mr Howells said a no-deal Brexit would lead to costly trade barriers and disrupt its supply chain. \"In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,\" he told the Wake up to Money programme. \"And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds.\" \"Likewise when we're looking at componentry coming the other way, again [it could cost] tens of millions in terms of tariffs coming into the UK.\" Supply chain risks Like other carmakers in Britain, Honda only stores about an hour's worth of components at its Swindon plant to keep costs down. Instead it relies on about 350 truckloads of parts that are delivered from the continent each day. Mr Howells said the loss of \"frictionless trade\" in this supply chain would harm its production output and competitiveness. \"If we are shipping and competing against a European manufacturer in Europe, they are not incurring those tariffs,\" he said. \"And in the UK it would be the componentry cost that would be the main additional burden we would have to carry for UK customers.\" A host of carmakers in Britain, including Nissan and Jaguar, have warned a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry. EU customers buy about \u20ac15bn ($18.5bn; \u00a313bn) worth of British-made cars per year, accounting for 53% of the UK's vehicle exports. However, despite uncertainty over a future trade deal, carmakers such as Nissan, BMW and Toyota have committed to expanding production in Britain since the Brexit vote. Mr Howells told the BBC that Honda was preparing for a potential no-deal outcome by carrying \"a little bit more componentry than we otherwise would\" and by reviewing its production schedules.

He also said the firm supported the Prime Minister's Chequer's deal, which proposes following a \"common rule book\" with the EU for trade in goods. Critics say the deal would make Britain a rule taker, not a rule maker, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals around the world.

Mr Poots said that could not continue, so he was closing car parks and stopping public access to parks, forests and nature reserves, \"where possible\". He said he was also urging people not to come on foot, but rather to stay at home. Other closures The National Trust made a similar decision.

The defendants say they are being deprived of sleep and are poorly fed, according to a defence lawyer. They deny hooliganism charges in the case, which has divided Russia. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Mariya Alekhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich were taken into custody in February after performing a protest song against President Vladimir Putin at Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral. The song outraged the Russian Orthodox Church, which accused them of blasphemy. Supporters say the case reflects the state's growing intolerance of government opponents. The first prosecution witness called on Wednesday testified that he was not in the cathedral during the performance and had only seen it on video, the BBC's Daniel Sandford reports from the courtroom. 'Punishing regime' Proceedings were interrupted for several hours to allow Ms Alekhina to be given treatment after a fall in her blood sugar levels, defence lawyer Nikolay Polozov told Russian media. He added that Ms Alekhin was a vegan and needed a special diet. Later on Wednesday, there was a further interruption when Ms Alekhina again repeatedly complained about feeling poorly, according to media reports. Mr Polozov told the Interfax news agency that the defendants have been subjected to a punishing regime since the start of their trial. \"For a third day running, the girls have been woken at 5am, held in a 1sq m (11sq ft) unventilated room, after which they are taken to court,\" he said. \"They are not fed, and court sessions last up to 12 hours, during which they are only given 20-30 minutes for a small snack of dry rations. They are then taken back to remand after midnight. They are also denied an evening meal and can only sleep for small number of hours.\" The women are facing the charge of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred or hostility and could face up to seven years in prison. At the start of their trial on Monday, the three pleaded not guilty, but apologised for the offence their performance had caused. The case has divided Russia, with many feeling the women are being made an example of as part of attempts to clamp down on the opposition.",

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia revealed that he could also open a probe into Google's mobile operating system Android. Google said it continued to work with the commission to resolve the matter. The dispute has been running since 2010, after rivals, including British price-comparison site Foundem, complained that the way Google displayed results was anti-competitive. In Europe Google has a 90% share of the search market. Toll road In a deal hammered out in February, Google agreed to reserve space near the top of its European search pages for competitors, which would be open to rivals to bid for via an auction. This auction could generate an extra income of up more than 300 million euros for Google, said rivals. \"Under the auction system Google would get another massive revenue stream. It's a bit like telling a robber than he can't rob any more but instead can set a toll on the High Street,\" said David Wood, a lawyer that represents iComp (Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace) of which Foundem and Microsoft are members. \"The real remedy is for Google to use the same algorithm for third-party sites that it applies to its own,\" he added. He urged the European Commission to push this solution as part of its powers. Writing on the Google Europe blog, executive chairman Eric Schmidt quoted Mr Almunia saying that imposing \"strict equal treatment could mean returning to the old world of Google displaying only 10 undifferentiated search results\". \"We're trying to get you direct answers to your queries because it's quicker and less hassle than the 10 blue links Google used to show,\" he said. \"Nor is it true that we are promoting our own products at the expense of the competition,\" he added. Mr Almunia had previously indicated that he was happy with the changes but had changed his mind in the wake of \"very, very negative\" feedback from rivals such as Microsoft and Expedia, he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \"Some complainants have introduced new arguments, new data, new considerations. We now need to to analyse this and see if we can find solutions, Google can find solutions, to some of these concerns that we find justified,\" he told reporters. This represents the third rejection of Google's solutions and experts think that it is now unlikely that an agreement will be reached during Mr Almunia's term in office, which finishes at the end of October. If no agreement is reached, Google faces a heavy fine.",

Swansea Crown Court heard Mr Bloomfield had been sitting on a stool at the bar near Mr Payne and his partner. The jury was shown CCTV of a can of alcohol Mr Bloomfield was holding touching the back of Mr Payne's partner, and Mr Payne is then seen arguing with Mr Bloomfield before grabbing him by the throat and throwing him to the floor.

The coffin was also driven to the home of Banks's former club Stoke City where hundreds more chanted and applauded. Jack and Sir Bobby Charlton were among mourners at a later church service. The brothers - who won the World Cup with Banks in 1966 - attended Stoke Minster where Wembley teammate Hurst paid tribute. Hurst said it was a \"very sad day\", describing his former teammate as the \"greatest goalkeeper we've had\". The funeral started with a rendition of Abide with Me - a hymn synonymous with the FA Cup final. Monday's service was held on the 47th anniversary of Stoke City's 1972 League Cup final victory over Chelsea in which Banks played a leading role. Before the funeral, members of the public stood five or six-deep on pavements around Stoke-on-Trent, with people inside the bet365 Stadium chanting \"England's number one\" as Banks's achievements were displayed on a big screen. His coffin was carried by goalkeepers from his three ex-clubs, Stoke, Leicester City and Chesterfield. The pallbearers were Stoke and England goalkeeper Jack Butland; Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel; Chesterfield keeper Joe Anyon; and England and Burnley's Joe Hart. The service ended with a recording of the song My Way performed by Frank Sinatra. Banks, who died on 12 February aged 81, started his career at Chesterfield before joining Leicester City in 1959 for \u00a37,000. At Leicester, he established himself as England's number one, earning his first international cap in 1963 against Scotland. In eight years at Leicester, he was runner-up in two FA Cup finals and won the League Cup in 1964, before joining Stoke in 1967. He stayed at the Potters until his retirement from professional football, winning the League Cup again in 1972, the club's only major honour. Fifa named him goalkeeper of the year six times and he earned 73 caps for England. He played in every game of the 1966 World Cup campaign, culminating in the 4-2 victory over West Germany in the final at Wembley. Hurst delivered a eulogy, describing Banks as \"a superstar on the field, [but] off the field he was an ordinary guy with no airs or graces\". He added: \"He was a joker, a funny man, for over 50 years, and every time we met during our careers or years after he would come up and joke.\" Stoke City chairman Peter Coates told mourners: \"We regard him as our adopted, famous son. \"He was fully integrated into the community at all levels and he was at home with us and we were at home with him.\" Banks's daughter Wendy said the outpouring of love had been a comfort, adding: \"It makes you feel very humble and proud all at the same time.\" \"It was football, Match of the Day and laughs; I miss everything already,\" she said.

It said delays in accessing labour markets from EU countries have the potential, in some instances, of leading to production being shut in. The UK government said employers could continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020. The report said about 5% of workers in the UK oil and gas sector come from other EU countries. That figure rises to seven percent for the offshore workforce. The report said it was \"vital that arrangements are in place between the UK and EU to allow the continued frictionless movement of people\". One example related to emergency response vessels stationed close to platforms, which require skilled engineers to operate. 'Continued volatility' The report said that if difficulties arose in recruiting replacements then platforms would have to shut down operations and production. To minimise the impact of Brexit, Oil and Gas UK said it was vital that the UK government secured frictionless access to markets and labour, maintained a strong voice in Europe for the industry, and protected the internal energy market. The 2018 Economic Report revealed that oil prices in the first half of the year were 30% higher than 2017, averaging more than $70 per barrel. Along with the continued drive to bring down costs, that was estimated to have created more than \u00a310bn of free cash flow. But it said investors \"will continue to favour a conservative outlook\" because of the continued volatility of the oil price. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: \"Industry is emerging from one of the most testing downturns in its history. However, the steps that have been taken by industry, government and the regulator have delivered tangible results. \"Despite the improvements seen in recent years, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Record low drilling activity, coupled with the supply chain squeeze, threaten industry's ability to effectively service an increase in activity and maximise economic recovery. \"The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) is a more attractive investment proposition - our challenge now is to take advantage of this. \"We have to drive an increase in activity while continuing to find and implement even more efficient ways of working which support the health of supply chain companies whilst also keeping costs under control.\" The report said the cost of producing oil had halved since its peak and was now averaging around $15 per barrel. This has followed an industry-wide drive to bring down costs and extend the life of the UK sector. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"The oil and gas industry is crucial to the UK's economy and energy security. That's why we are providing a \u00a32.3bn support package of measures. \"EU citizens make a huge contribution to the oil and gas industry and we've provided certainty to the industry that employers will be free to continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020.\"",

The test unleashed a powerful 6.3-magnitude tremor which was felt across the border in China. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests so far, all at Punggye-ri, which consists of a system of tunnels dug beneath a mountainous region. 38 North said its latest pictures, which were taken a day after the latest test, showed landslides as well as numerous areas of gravel and scree fields which were \"lofted\" from the tremors. Lofting occurs when shockwaves force material to be lifted up from the ground, and the material falls back down in the same place. The disturbances took place near Mount Mantap, the highest point in the test site. They were \"more numerous and widespread than what we have seen from any of the five tests North Korea previously conducted\", the site's analysis said.

The repeated tests have prompted concerns about the test site's longevity, although experts are divided.

He added: \"That is why the Scottish government now must get on and introduce a presumption against short-term sentences of less than 12 months. \"Ministers need to urgently ease the pressure on our prison system and change the way we deal with less serious offenders to make our communities safer.\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland has the highest rate of incarceration per 100,000 of population of any Western European country, which is why we are focused on action to stop people going to prison in the first place. \"Our approach to reducing reoffending has seen reoffending rates drop to a 19-year low, and we are committed this year to extending the presumption against short prison sentences in favour of more effective community penalties.\"",

Campaigners say the environmental risks of fracturing rock to release gas are too great. A spokesman says the Trust has not changed its position but will review any new evidence in the future. Fracking is the process of drilling down into shale rock before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. In an interview with The Times Newspaper, Dame Helen said: \"We all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it we would reach a view.\" She added: \"We are waiting for the evidence. We have an open mind.\" However, the Trust's position on fracking says: \"We have a presumption against fracking on our land because natural gas is a fossil gas. \"The mining process also gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts.\" It goes on to say: \"Whilst the use of natural gas might buy time to develop secure, renewable alternative energy sources, it also risks distracting us from focusing on the development of these and on the need for us all to concentrate on using less energy in the first place. 'Fool's gold' A Trust spokesman said: \"Our position is a presumption against fracking on our land. \"It doesn't mean that in time that won't change - if the environmental and visual impacts are negligible and it is part of a strategy to move to a low carbon economy.\" The Trust adopted its position of a presumption against the gas/oil extraction technique during the summer's anti-fracking protests at Balcombe, West Sussex, where energy company Caudrilla planned to carry out test drilling. Earlier this year, the charity's director of conservation, Peter Nixon, described fracking as \"fool's gold\". He said: \"If it takes our eyes off the ball from the need for energy efficiency and a long-term sustainable source of renewable energy, it will be fool's gold.\" The spokesman told BBC News: \"Shale gas is a fossil fuel [that] may prove a fool's gold and distract attention from a shift to renewables. \"The environmental and visual impacts are also unproven, and this is what concerns many people. We want to see more evidence on what this impact will be.\"",

Since then, they have received more than 1,000 letters from around the world. There were plenty of things to talk about. Norman likes bingo, bowls and colouring in while Kathleen wanted to be pen pals with someone who likes Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell. Madge enjoys getting her hair done and crocheting while Eddie loves chocolate, and Teresa likes knitting while sipping on a cup of tea with a few sneaky biscuits. \"We couldn't believe the reaction,\" Brooklands' activities coordinator Laura Clerkin told BBC News NI. \"The whole thing just blew up, it was amazing. \"There was such a range in ages of people getting involved which was lovely too. We had everyone from children aged seven or eight, right up to people in college, adults, other nursing home residents and retired people.\" She added: \"One resident said she loves animals and she has been sent lots of photos of people's animals which she has loved, others have had gifts sent to them to do with their hobbies, like knitting, or the things they said they liked, such as chocolate. \"It's just nice to have been able to do something so positive in the middle of all of this madness.\" Ms Clerkin admits there was a little bit of confusion when the letters started to pour in. \"When the letters came in, they were placed in a big envelope and taken to each resident and, at the very beginning, some of them wanted to know how this had happened and how did anyone know where they lived. \"They are from a different generation, they don't really understood social media, so we had to explain to them how it worked at first but they all loved it once they realised people were writing to them and wanted to know more about their lives.\" Brooklands closed to visitors in March in response to Covid-19. A few months later, it reopened, but only for about a week and a half as cases in the local community started to rise and so Brooklands was forced to close again to keep residents safe. \"So, from March to November, we have only been open for a week and a half and even then time was restricted and there were social distancing measures in place and that has been very difficult for our residents,\" said Ms Clerkin. \"Everyone is doing their best to keep them occupied and happy and they're all doing great.

They argue that an international inquiry into the Sri Lankan conflict is needed, a proposal that has been roundly rejected by Colombo. The army defeated Tamil Tiger rebels after intense fighting in May 2009. 'Unsolved' In two days of hearings, the panel has taken detailed testimony from four expert witnesses. There have been some quite strong political messages for the government, though little challenge to them on human rights. Leading social scientist Godfrey Gunatilleke - who comes from the majority Sinhalese community - said that a year after the defeat of the rebels, the human and political roots of the conflict remained unsolved. \"Unless we forge that national consensus and develop a Sri Lankan identity to which all communities can belong, to which all communities can owe allegiance... we will still be managing a conflict situation and dealing with problems as they arise,\" he said. Mr Gunatilleke said that a full and transparent account was needed of the war's final, controversial months. 'Impartiality' On issues of human rights violations, however, both he and the panel members said the international community was to blame for not sufficiently condemning rights violations by the rebels, specifically their use of people as human shields. Thursday's other witness, an expert on child protection, was heavily critical of the foreign monitors of a failed ceasefire, and of foreign NGOs in general. In a report, the US State Department says it has concerns about the commission' s independence and its mandate. The Sri Lankan government has said in response that the commission - appointed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa - is \"dedicated to fairness and impartiality\".",

Sussex Police said the sheep, many of them pregnant, had been herded into a tight group against a fence and gate bordering woodland. They had panicked and died either from shock or by being crushed. Sgt Tom Carter said there were no signs of the sheep being savaged but police were \"all but 100% certain\" the deaths were caused by dogs. The flock, worth about \u00a317,000, died just north of the A286 at the eastern end of West Dean village. James Osman, the National Farmers Union adviser for Sussex, said he believed it was the worst incident of its kind in living memory. \"Talking to colleagues around the country, the number of deaths is double what we have come across in the past,\" he said. Analysis By Claire Marshall, BBC environment correspondent This couldn't have happened at a worse time of year. Spring is when ewes have their lambs, and they are at their most vulnerable - many of the sheep that were killed were pregnant. A sheep doesn't actually have to be savaged by a predator. They panic easily and their instinct is to follow each other, so they can die of shock or by being crushed, which is what seems to have happened here. The likely culprit? A dog that was out of control. They call it \"sheep worrying\". Dog owners have already been warned - around 18,500 livestock were killed or injured in this way last year. That's a rise of more than a third. So why are these figures going up? Perhaps it's because more and more of us keep dogs as companions. The Pet Food Manufacturer's Association reckons that a quarter of all households now own a dog. That's 8.5 million dogs - a lot of animals to keep under control. Sgt Carter said the flock was last checked at lunchtime on Sunday and the attack could have occurred at any time over the next 24 hours. \"It was a terrible sight,\" he said. \"This is not just about the Mr Wyeth's livelihood - and it will cost him at least another \u00a32,000 to dispose of the carcasses - but also his emotional attachment to the animals that he has raised and nurtured. \"We have seen a rise in sheep-worrying incidents and as spring approaches more dog owners will be heading for the countryside to exercise their pets. \"We urge people to keep their dogs on a lead while they are walking in rural areas and around livestock.\" The West Dean Estate, run by the Edward James Foundation, includes West Dean College and West Dean Gardens",

Since coming to power in October, the Law and Justice party (PiS) has regularly come to blows with the media and the opposition.

They require a two-thirds majority of the 15 judges to support a ruling for it to be valid, and also stipulate a quorum of 13 judges for rulings to be valid. The PiS says the changes are needed to reflect the new balance of power after its landslide election win last year, Reuters news agency reported. Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said the Constitutional Court's judgment would not be legally valid because the court had failed to adhere to the rule changes introduced by her party.

The amendments to the law governing the court are being investigated by the European Commission for a possible breach of the rule of law.

Ofsted said the school's strengths were providing children with \"good quality accommodation\", children said that it was a good school, and leaders and managers have a \"good understanding about private fostering arrangements\".

        "input": "By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The prime minister was asked how she could expect their support given the 1% cap on pay rises, leaving Theresa May battling to explain why such restraint was necessary. After all, in its manifesto, the Conservatives said that NHS spending was to increase. By the end of the Parliament, the Tories have promised that funding in England will be \u00a38bn higher a year once inflation is taken into account. It does not set out how this will be paid for, although the party insists economic growth is key to spending more. What's in the manifesto? However, as with all manifestos, you need to look at what is not being said as well as what is. The \u00a38bn refers to only one part of the overall budget - the money allocated to front-line services. This accounts for just over three-quarters of the entire health budget. There was a lack of detail about much of the rest of the pot, which goes on things like staff training and public health programmes such as stopping smoking, apart from the promise of extra investment in buildings. During the last Parliament these pots were cut to help pump more money into the front-line services. The same could happen again - albeit with some protection this time for the buildings budget. What is also not obvious is that the \u00a38bn is much less than the health service has been used to. Before 2010, the NHS had been getting an extra 4% a year over its history. This reflects the fact that the health service faces rising costs from factors such as the ageing population, the cost of new drugs and lifestyle issues like obesity. But those rises dried up between 2010 and 2017. Since then the NHS has been getting about 1% a year. What difference will the \u00a38bn for the next Parliament make to that trend? Very little. Forecasts suggest the spending plans amount to just over 1%. But the Tories are not alone on this. The Nuffield Trust think tank has been looking at the spending plans set out by all three main parties - and concluded there is very little between them. And all three fall well short of the 4% average. It explains why, despite the promises of extra money, the Tories have felt it necessary to continue with the pay cap. It's not in the manifesto - instead that talks about \"benefits\" such as flexible working and new support for staff with mental health problems - but it remains very much a part of their wider NHS policy. Following the last election, the then chancellor George Osborne announced public sector pay was to be capped at 1% until 2019. That, as the nurse pointed out on live television, continues to remain in place. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter",

The show, based in a fictional suburb outside Melbourne, has been accused of not reflecting ethnic diversity during its 29-year history. Previous indigenous actors who have appeared in the soap include Tony Briggs in the late 1980s. He was the first Aboriginal actor to appear on the show. In 2012, a South Asian family, called the Kapoors, moved into Ramsay Street, but they were written out of the soap a year later. 'Best people' Actor Sachin Joab, who played Ajay Kapoor, told Digital Spy last year: \"It was more of a shock to us knowing that it wasn't just one multicultural actor who was being written out, it was every single multicultural full-time actor on the show. \"All four of us were written out in the first year of our full-time contracts, which felt like a massive step backwards in terms of cultural diversity on the show. \"Australia is stuck in some sort of time capsule... For some reason when it's fiction over here, the industry chooses to exclude non-whites and include whites only. It's very unrealistic given that Australia is a very multicultural country,\" he added.

He graduated from the country's National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA), and was named best newcomer in the 2011 Sydney theatre awards. He recently completed the feature film Strangerland starring Nicole Kidman, Joseph Fiennes and Guy Pearce, due for release in 2015.

They are among more than 100 instalments which were not retained by the BBC. The announcement was made on Sunday at Missing Believed Wiped, an event held at the British Film Institute (BFI). The BFI, based in London, has been working with broadcasters and film collectors to recover missing recordings of many different television series. Television programmes only began to be routinely recorded in the late 1950s. Previously, they were broadcast live. Even when it became possible to make recordings, video tape was so expensive that most transmission tapes were wiped, so they could be re-used. In the 1970s, the BBC commissioned a report by the historian Lord Briggs. His findings prompted efforts to improve the archiving of television programmes. Although original transmission tapes did not survive, programmes were transferred on to film for broadcasters abroad and it is these prints that the BFI sometimes recover. Doctor Who was sold all over the world in the 1960s. The latest two episodes to be found were in the private collection of a retired broadcast engineer, Terry Burnett, who bought them at a school fete in Hampshire in the 1980s. Mr Burnett had no idea the BBC did not have the recordings - it was only when he mentioned them casually in conversation to Ralph Montagu, head of heritage at Radio Times, that their significance was recognised. Airlock is the third episode of a four-part story called Galaxy Four, transmitted in the autumn of 1965. Hartnell is accompanied by Peter Purves, later a presenter on the children's series Blue Peter, and Maureen O'Brien, now better known as a novelist. The plot involves the desperate attempts by the Drahvins, a race of cloned females, to escape a planet which is about to explode. The story also marks the only appearance in the series of tiny robots known as the Chumblies. The other re-discovered episode is the second part of The Underwater Menace, from early 1967. It sees a mad scientist attempting to restore Atlantis by draining the ocean into the Earth's core. Patrick Troughton, in only his third appearance as The Doctor, was apparently unimpressed with the production. In a recent biography, his son Michael says he argued with the director Julia Smith - who went on to become the original producer of EastEnders - complaining bitterly about the \"ridiculous costumes and make-up of the fish people\". Innes Lloyd, who produced The Underwater Menace later admitted, \"it did look like something from a '50s American 'B' movie\". The find makes only a modest dent in the number of missing episodes, with 106 instalments broadcast between 1964 and 1969 still being sought. Among other items recovered and shown at Sunday's event were Emergency Ward 9, a play by Dennis Potter, and a comedy sketch featuring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.",

There was \"nothing by way of capital\" in the announcement which would allow ministers \"to invest in economic recovery\", he continued. Mr Murphy said there were also \"serious implications\" for public sector pay awards. Apart from NHS workers and the low-paid, salaries will be frozen for much of the public sector in England as a result of the review. \"It is wrong to try and divide public sector workers - all public sector workers provide a huge service, this pandemic showed that they are vital in terms of functions,\" the finance minister explained. \"To put a divide between one group and another is not right.\" The finance minister said he would discuss the Spending Review with other executive ministers on Thursday. 'Series of crises' DUP Treasury Spokesperson Sammy Wilson said it was important that departments, public bodies, businesses and the public receive \"certainty about the impact of spending plans\".

He said the UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022 and government borrowing will rise to its highest outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the Spending Review announcement as \"bleak\". The Foyle MP said: \"There is very little in this spending review that will provide comfort to people or businesses in Northern Ireland preparing for the worst kind of Brexit settlement in a few weeks. \"Whether it's car dealers unsure of the scale of the tax increase they'll be compelled to pay or supply chain operators still waiting on clarification on transport and logistics rules, we are facing a series of crises that need to be resolved.\"",

It is only the second time Mr Trump has used his presidential veto since he took office in 2017. Opposition in Congress to his policy on Yemen grew last year after Saudi agents killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The resolution passed the House of Representatives in April and the Senate in March, the first time both chambers had supported a War Powers resolution, which limits the president's ability to send troops into action. \"This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\" Mr Trump said in the veto message. The House Speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, was among those to condemn President Trump for the move. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in March 2015, when the rebel Houthi movement seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government. The US has provided billions of dollars of weapons and intelligence to the coalition. The UN says at least 7,000 civilians have been killed in the country, with 65% of the deaths attributed to air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. US senators have accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering the murder of Mr Khashoggi, but Saudi prosecutors have insisted it was a \"rogue operation\" and that the agents were not acting on his orders. President Trump first used his veto last month after Congress voted to block his declaration of a national emergency on the US southern border in order to secure funding for his border wall.",

He also announced a pilot scheme in Fife in which the parents of all children subject to stop and search would be given a letter explaining why. There were 640,000 stop searches last year, with 25,000 involving children. The age of criminal responsibility in Scotland is currently eight - one of the lowest in Europe. Mr Mawson's comments to the Scottish parliament committee appeared to indicate that the change to stop search procedures would cover those under eight. Police Scotland later clarified that these searches would end for all children under 12. Mr Mawson, who has responsibility for local policing in the west of Scotland, told the Scottish Parliament's justice sub-committee that ending the practice was \"about doing the right thing\". Language and approach Last month a Freedom of Information request revealed children under 16 had committed more than 40,000 offences in Scotland in the past two years. Data obtained by BBC Scotland showed officers carried out 2,912 searches on children aged eight to 12 between April and December 2013. The Scottish Police Authority was asked to review stop and search on children following concerns about increasing use of the power. Mr Mawson said he \"thoroughly\" believed that stop search was effective in reducing particular crimes but said the force had agreed it needed to change its language and approach. Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokeswoman Alison McInnes welcomed the decision. \"I am delighted that after months of pressing the authorities for change to protect children, Police Scotland have finally conceded that the position was indefensible,\" she said. \"This is a victory for children and their rights. We've argued all along for them to be protected. \"This acceptance of the problems of voluntary stop and search demonstrates change is required. That change cannot stop here.\" Under the new Fife pilot the details of every person stopped and searched, and the reason why, will be recorded. In England and Wales children are held responsible for crimes at age 10. In Germany, Italy and Russia it is 14. Scottish ministers have increased the age of criminal prosecution to 12, meaning children aged between eight and 12 would be referred to the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration but not to the procurator fiscal.",

Across Northern Ireland, manufacturers and suppliers are working around the clock to satisfy a massive increase in orders. Restaurants have been able to sell takeaway food, but now they are creeping warily towards more extensive opening. 'Couldn't get a date' The Pizza Guyz shop in west Belfast has seating for sit-in customers but for the moment those seats will be used by its 10 delivery drivers. In a short time it envisages customers calling in to pick up orders but, to keep their staff and clients safe, owner Ciaran Kelly has installed a transparent screen at the counter. The problem has been finding supplies of the plastic and someone to fit it. \"We started looking four to five weeks ago and found that guys either had not got the materials or were on furlough and could not give a date to do the work for four to five weeks\". He said he was beginning to panic that they would not have the protection in place in time. Ciaran eventually tracked down a shop fitter who has now fitted a ceiling-to-counter screen with a gap cut to slide out pizza and slide in payment. 'Everything I get disappears' One major manufacturer of the polycarbon or acrylic sheets in Northern Ireland has been so busy it has shifts running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A small east Belfast business which cuts and shapes sheets to fit has been inundated with orders. Andrew Fleming's workshop is working long hours with a skeleton staff but has difficulty getting enough material to satisfy demand. \"I've been ordering maybe four times as much perspex as usual but everything I get in just disappears really quickly to customers,\" he said. \"The factory in England is working flat out but it can't keep up with demand.\" Offered twice the sum Shop fitter Sean Treacy knows how scarce and expensive the sheeting is. He predicted a rush to buy it and ordered early but found others wanted to buy it from him at any price. \"I was picking up sheets of polycarbon and while I was loading the van another client who hadn't ordered ahead offered me twice the sum I had just paid for it,\" he said. Sean says he did the decent thing and refused the extra money so he could fulfil his customers' orders on time The screens are likely to be semi-permanent fixtures while customers and staff feel there is a risk of Covid-19 being transmitted.",

They had been expecting reductions, but say these changes have been brought in without consultation, and some of them without good reason. Universities regularly review the courses they offer, but these appear directly linked to the impending budget cuts. Forty-three full-time and 10 part-time undergraduate courses have been withdrawn from the Ulster University prospectus. Eleven of them are history combinations, 20 are linked to film studies and six will go from the faculty of computing and engineering.

Children's commissioner Anne Longfield said the UK was creating \"Skype families\" who had been forced apart. The Home Office says the rules are lawful and compatible with rights. Since 2012, immigration rules have barred the entry of spouses from outside the European Union unless their British partner meets the minimum income threshold. 'Profound impact' The level rises to \u00a322,400 if a child is not a British or European Economic Area (EEA) citizen, with an additional levy of \u00a32,400 for each subsequent child. The rules were created as part of the then-coalition government's attempts to control immigration from outside Europe, with ministers arguing they would ensure no incoming families would be a burden on the UK taxpayer. In a study, researchers from Middlesex University and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants estimated the number of children affected by examining the number of people who have been refused visas or permission to settle since the changes were introduced. There are no official numbers for the number of children affected. Ms Longfield said the policy had created families in which children could speak to one of their parents only online - leading to suffering and distress. \"We are not talking about having unrestricted access but we need to put the heart back into this policy and consider the profound impact the rules have on this group of British children and their families,\" she said. Legal challenges Last year the Court of Appeal said the rules were lawful, despite a challenge arguing that they breached the right to family life and duties to protect the best interests of children. However, the issue is expected to be examined by the Supreme Court next year. The Home Office said: \"We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution. But family life must not be established here at the taxpayer's expense. \"The level of the minimum income threshold reflects the income at which a British family generally ceases to be able to access income-related benefits. \"The policy has been approved by Parliament, and upheld by the courts as lawful and compliant with our legal duty to safeguard and promote child welfare.\" But the campaign group Migrants' Rights Network said: \"The impression given by the Home Office is that the matter is settled in the courts, but that is far from being the case. \"The Home Office has failed to show that this policy does in fact save the taxpayer any money. \"In reality many people are unable to move abroad, and families who are forced to remain apart are even more likely to need assistance than if both partners are able to work and look after the children in the UK.\"",

The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1% which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2008. The employers maintain the offer is a good outcome for staff. The unions say they are willing to meet for last minute talks but say they are not optimistic \"as the employers had so far refused to engage in talks aimed at resolving the dispute\". 'Widespread anger' Michael MacNeil, head of higher education at UCU, said: \"There is widespread anger over the pay cuts staff have had to endure in recent years and all the reports we are getting suggest that Thursday's strike will be very well supported. \"We are amazed the employers are still refusing to sit down with us to try and resolve this without any need for disruption. There are precious few hours left now, but our offer of talks remains open.\" Unison's head of higher education Jon Richards accused university management of \"sitting on record surpluses, splashing out on senior management pay but refusing to give a decent wage to the staff who have made UK universities some of the best in the world\". The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents the universities as employers, has expressed disappointment at the rejection of the offer. 'Low impact' A spokesman for UCEA said that less than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote in favour of strike action and predicted \"a low level impact on students\". The spokesman said that they had made their final pay offer in May and had been engaged in a dispute resolution process with the unions throughout the summer. \"We have met repeatedly over the last six months and as recently as last week.\" The spokesman added that \"salary costs in most HE institutions will actually rise by around 3% this year. \"Many staff will also get generous incremental increases and contribution pay. These pay increases will be seen as generous by many looking into the sector.\" He added that the GMB union had agreed to accept the pay offer for its members employed by universities. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action.

But a group of senators have asked the constitutional court to examine it, in a move welcomed by Turkey. President Nicolas Sarkozy has yet to sign the bill, which Turkey has described as \"racist\". France has already recognised the killings in World War I as an act of genocide but the new bill means anyone denying it faces a year in jail and a fine of 45,000 euros ($57,000). Armenia says that up to 1.5 million people died in 1915-16 as the Ottoman empire split. Turkey, which rejects the term \"genocide\", has said the number of deaths was much smaller. Defenders of the bill point out that it covers all acts of genocide. Fears of rift A petition against the bill gathered the support of 76 senators, more than the minimum 60 required to ask the constitutional council to examine it. According to France's AFP news agency, the petition was led by a group of left-wing senators. The council is obliged to deliver its judgement within a month but this can be reduced to eight days if the government deems the matter urgent. Ankara warned earlier that Turkey planned to respond with unspecified measures against France if the bill became law. A spokesman for the Turkish embassy in Paris, Engin Solakoglu, told AFP on Tuesday: \"Ties between France and Turkey are going to ease. \"There had been a risk of a rift. For now, this rift appears to have been avoided.\" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the petition in Ankara, according to Turkish private television channel NTV. \"This move is in keeping with what we would expect from France,\" he was quoted as saying. \"I hope the constitutional council will do what is necessary.\" He had previously described the bill as a \"racist and discriminatory approach\". The Turkish government argues that judging what happened in eastern Turkey in 1915-16 should be left to historians, and that the new French law will restrict freedom of speech. The killings are regarded as the seminal event of modern Armenian history, a tragic bond uniting one of the world's most dispersed peoples. Among the other states which formally recognise them as genocide are Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and Uruguay, but the UK, US, Israel and others use different terminology.

It found patients were denied pain relief due to staff shortages, while others were \"frightened\" by nurses. The study was commissioned after it emerged cancer records were falsified. Health sector regulator Monitor placed the Colchester Hospital University Foundation Trust in special measures last year after its cancer services were criticised. Acting chief executive Dr Lucy Moore said the survey was \"extremely helpful\" and was concerned some patients felt they had not been heard. \"It finds most patients and carers said they were satisfied with the treatments and care we provided and acknowledges that we have made improvements in 2014,\" she said. 'Mumbling' doctors Healthwatch Essex, which is an independent organisation, found a third of cancer patients were not satisfied with their treatment and many suffered poor care. Referring to individual cases at the two hospitals, both run by the trust, the report said: \"Patients were in such considerable pain, which was not being managed by the hospital, that they had resorted to phoning relatives in search of help.\" There was also criticism about the way diagnoses were revealed, with one case of a doctor \"mumbling\" so much that a patient did not immediately know they had cancer. However, many patients also praised the specialist cancer nurses, Essex County Hospital and a specialist suite where patients are treated. Dr Tom Nutt, chief executive of Healthwatch Essex, said the report showed \"the importance of listening to patients and their carers\".

Of those who survive, just under 3% have moderate or severe impairments and 4.4% have mild impairments. Prof Lawn, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said: \"The perception is you need intensive care for pre-term babies, \"But 85% of babies born premature are six weeks early or less. They need help feeding, with temperature control and they are more prone to infection. \"It's really only before 32 weeks that their lungs are immature and they need help breathing, She added: \"Unless there are those breathing problems, kangaroo care is actually better because it promotes breastfeeding and reduces infection.\" Speaking ahead of World Prematurity Day on Friday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who leads the Every Woman Every Child movement, which promotes improvements to healthcare for women and children, said: \"Three-quarters of the one million babies who die each year from complications associated with prematurity could have been saved with cost-effective interventions, even without intensive care facilities.\" Duncan Wilbur, from the UK charity Bliss, said, \"While kangaroo care saves lives in Africa, it is also incredibly important for babies born too soon all over the world. \"Here in the UK our medical technology is extremely advanced but simply giving a baby kangaroo care or skin-to-skin can help make a baby's breathing and heart rate more regular, it can help a baby's discomfort during certain medical procedures and importantly can benefit breastfeeding and bonding between the baby and parents.\" Pregnancy risks Studies to be published this weekend in the Pediatric Research journal show boys are 14% more likely to be born prematurely - and boys who are premature are more likely to die or experience disability than girls. Common disabilities include learning disorders and cerebral palsy. Prof Lawn said: \"One partial explanation for more preterm births among boys is that women pregnant with a boy are more likely to have placental problems, pre-eclampsia, and high blood pressure, all associated with preterm births.\" She added: \"Baby boys have a higher likelihood of infections, jaundice, birth complications, and congenital conditions, but the biggest risk for baby boys is due to preterm birth. \"For two babies born at the same degree of prematurity, a boy will have a higher risk of death and disability compared to a girl. \"Even in the womb, girls mature more rapidly than boys, which provides an advantage, because the lungs and other organs are more developed.\"",

ScotRail apologised for the signalling problems, and said it acted swiftly to arrange for rail tickets to be valid for Stagecoach bus services. Ongoing problems are understood to include maintenance issues and the late arrival of new trains which had a knock-on impact on staff training. A ScotRail spokesperson said: \"We're sorry to our customers who have experienced disruption - the vast majority of our services have run, and we're working hard to improve that. \"Anyone delayed by 30 minutes or more as a result of a cancellation is entitled to compensation through our Delay Repay Guarantee.

But the early days of the new timetable have been marred by staff shortages, with many workers not ready for implementation of the new services. Many trains have been cancelled as a result, and carriages have been cut on some existing services, resulting in overcrowding. The RMT union said the underlying was that ScotRail did not have enough staff - and was relying on its members working overtime. Scotland organiser Mick Hogg told BBC Radio Scotland's Beattie programme: \"The fact of the matter is that ScotRail do not have the resources to do the training and run Scotland's trains. He added: \"If staff refuse to work the overtime, the employer ScotRail has a problem. \"No-one can be forced to work their free time, their rest days. ScotRail is very much reliant on staff working the overtime.\" Last week ScotRail released new figures showing that punctuality had improved, and was at its best since September.

Chris Jones, deputy director of support for learners for the Welsh Government, said he asked Ruthin School for an action plan in 2016 following targeted inspections by Estyn and CIW which both raised a number of concerns about safeguarding. He agreed there were weaknesses within the current system, but other than closing the school, no other options were open to the Welsh Government. The inquiry heard evidence that Mr Belfield had a controlling influence at Ruthin, where teachers were afraid to speak openly during inspections and were deterred from joining unions. The school's social media policy prohibited any staff member other than Mr Belfield contacting pupils on those platforms. Mr Belfield was dismissed after Estyn found pupils were \"at risk of harm\" because of safeguarding failures. Ms Holland also told the hearing she was concerned Mr Belfield had set up an online school since his dismissal. She said he is unable to be struck off the teaching register because he is a non-qualified teacher. The inquiry continues.",

The 56-year-old told the panel he had been sacked after he raised concerns. Clarks refutes this, saying Mr Shearwood was fired due to his conduct at work. On Monday, the panel heard allegations he had made sexist, racist and homophobic comments. Mr Shearwood is claiming unfair dismissal for the way he was forced to quit the family-owned firm last year. Addressing the company's financial position, he said: \"My concern is we would be trading insolvent and we should go to the shareholders as they would lose their assets. \"I believe we had a duty of care to tell the shareholders who should know the state of the business was dire.\" Employment judge Derek Reed asked why he had not approached shareholders directly. Mr Shearwood said that in his role he reported to chairman Tom O'Neil, who controlled the board, and he would have been fired for going straight to shareholders. 'Tried to influence him' Judge Reed said: \"If you're saying Mr O'Neil was trying to suppress this, and that was the wrong thing, why didn't you do the right thing and tell the shareholders? \"Are you saying you were afraid of being sacked?\" Mr Shearwood replied: \"Yes.\" He added: \"My method of working with him was to try to influence him and make him do the right thing.\" He told the panel he had not raised any issues at a formal board meeting due to concerns about how Mr O'Neil would react. Mr Shearwood also claimed Mr O'Neil had asked employee Ed Hayes to alter minutes of meetings and destroy evidence. Mr Hayes subsequently resigned. Clarks said this was due to his workload commute and young family.

Defence lawyer David Sutherland said his client's position was simply that the allegations did not take place, and denied any impropriety.

Shoppers around the world are being encouraged to use smartphones instead of cards to pay for in-store purchases. Alibaba's Alipay currently dominates China's electronic payments market. Apple confirmed its expansion into China on its website. \"You can now support Apple Pay for your customers in China, providing an easy, secure, and private way for them to pay using their China UnionPay credit and debit cards,\" the firm said. Apple's head Tim Cook later announced the launch of Apple Pay in China early on Thursday via his Weibo account. Several reports have indicated that as many as 20 China-based lenders will be supporting Apple Pay, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). ICBC had not responded to written inquiries on Thursday, however. Growing market There has been a rapid take-up of smartphones in China, with an estimated 68% of the population now owning one - and digital wallets are becoming a more popular way to pay for goods and services. UnionPay's alliance with Apple is an extension of its plans to make the most of that growing market. However, analyst Bryan Ma of research firm IDC told the BBC that Apple was likely to garner a smaller user base in China compared to competitors like AliPay and Tencent's WeChat Payment. \"This is in part because Alibaba and Tencent payment systems are used for more things, like money transfers, whereas Apple Pay might be limited to just retail point-of-sale and possibly App Store transactions for now,\" he explained. \"There will be a natural, gravitational pull though for some people to Apple Pay - particularly people in big cities - because of Apple's brand. So they will be able to attract a selected customer base that way.\" Mr Ma said another issue was that Apple Pay would use the Near Field Communication (NFC) method of contactless communication, rather than the barcode-like method of electronic payments using QR codes. QR codes were widely used by Apple Pay's China-based competitors like Alipay, Mr Ma said, and could reach a wider market because more phones could read them compared to phones that could read NFC tags. By 2017 it is estimated the global mobile payments market will be worth some $1tn (\u00a3650bn). In addition to Apple Pay, Google's Android Pay is available at more than one million locations in the US, while Samsung Pay was launched in South Korea in August, followed by a launch in the US the following month.",

The first minister also knows that it is extremely unlikely that any incoming prime minister would give their approval for another indyref. We may not know who the next Tory leader is going to be - but you can be sure that any candidate who wants to secure the votes of Conservative members in Scotland will need to firmly rule out allowing a second referendum anytime soon. So why is Ms Sturgeon going ahead with preparations for a referendum that seems unlikely to happen within her preferred timescale of the second half of next year? She says that the UK government is currently in such chaos it is not possible to predict what their future policy on anything might be. And she warns that denying Scottish voters the right to make a choice about whether they want to live in an independent country is not only undemocratic but also politically unsustainable And that is the argument you will keep hearing from the SNP. That to deny a vote exposes what they describe as the \"democratic deficit\" facing Scotland. They hope to stir frustration and anger amongst voters, even those who don't currently support independence, that they should not be told what they can and cannot do by a prime minister in London. Amongst those who do passionately support independence there is impatience to get on with it. Huge marches demanding another referendum are a reasonably frequent occurrence in Scottish towns and cities and Nicola Sturgeon needs to give some hope to her most enthusiastic foot soldiers that another vote is coming. Or at least that she is doing everything she can to hasten the day that they will get to have their say. The risk is that while she may be able to gradually build the case that Westminster should not be allowed to block another independence vote, she may not be able to do so quickly enough to satisfy many of her grassroots. And she may not be able to do so before the next Scottish Parliament elections in 2021.",

Judge Daniel Williams said Rowlands had \"contemplated\" killing Lauren for more than a year. Ms Griffiths, from Oswestry, Shropshire, was described as happy, bubbly and popular in court. In contrast, her fianc\u00e9 was described as self-absorbed and remorseless. Rowlands strangled Ms Griffiths to death, wrapped her body in tape and clingfilm and then ordered drugs and takeaway pizza to be delivered to their Glynrhondda Street flat.

She was found by a neighbour on 11 February 1993 and died 11 days later. Police believe somebody knew the identity of the person who killed the \"frail and vulnerable old lady\". The fatal assault happened just over 18 months after widow Mrs Shelley was the victim of a violent robbery at her home. Police said \u00a312,637 was stolen from her bungalow on that occasion and during the second incident the offender was \"looking for valuables to take\". The original investigation saw 70 officers working on the case, a \u00a310,000 reward for information and a Crimewatch appeal but despite several arrests no-one was caught. Andy Guy, major crime review team manager for Norfolk and Suffolk Police, said: \"She was a vulnerable old lady, she was 82 years old, she was living alone, had previously been a victim of a robbery and a significant amount of money was taken. \"Is that linked to the second offence? Maybe.\" Police said they were reviewing the 397 exhibits taken during the original investigation. These include household objects which might have been touched by the offender, Mrs Shelley's clothing and items taken from people under arrest. A 'Churchillian recluse' It was to former Martlesham policeman Frank Ryder's door that Doris Shelley came when she was first attacked. The animal lover had been locked in the bathroom and had climbed out of the window. He continued to do welfare checks after that incident but, although still living in the Martlesham police house, had been posted out to Felixstowe when she was fatally attacked. Mr Ryder described Mrs Shelley, who had been widowed in her 20s, as \"fiercely independent\" with an \"indomitable spirit\". \"She was almost Churchillian, 'I've lost my husband, I live alone, I'm not going to let it beat me and I can do it without anybody's help',\" he said. Mr Guy said they were trying to enhance the intelligence gathered 25 years ago. \"Science has moved on and we're now able to take advantage of things that weren't available in 1993,\" he said. \"We're looking at all those exhibits and seeing if there's any potential to bring to justice whoever was responsible for Doris's murder.\" Lines of inquiry included linking the attack to an assault on a postmistress in nearby Eyke the previous year, but police said the two were not linked forensically. A red car, possibly a Ford Sierra, was also spotted in the vicinity, police said. Mrs Shelley's bungalow was later demolished and the land sold.

Motorists are advised to plan their route carefully and avoid lowland areas near rivers, says Peter Rodger, chief examiner at the Institute for Advanced Motoring. But if you are confronted by flooding or large pools on the road, how should you react? Slow down to give yourself time to assess how deep the water is and whether it is moving, Rodger says. A good rule of thumb is not to enter water more than six inches deep, or four inches if it is moving, he adds. For a vehicle with high clearance like a 4x4 this may be slightly higher. Risks include shorting the electrics, flooding the engine, underwater obstructions or being swept away. If you can't see where you are going to come out of the water, consider turning round. Enter the water slowly so that only your front wheels are submerged. If you feel the water is moving, reverse out before you become stuck. Drive on the shallowest section of the road. Leave space to avoid swamping others. Don't go too fast - it risks letting water into the engine. Keep the revs high to stop water entering the exhaust. Stay in first gear and drive at walking pace - about 2-3mph. Use the clutch to allow greater revving. On an automatic use the brakes to achieve the same effect. Never take your foot off the accelerator, Rodger warns. Once out of the water, lightly brake to dry the brakes. If you do get stuck, unless your life is in danger, ring for help before leaving the vehicle, Rodger says. Even this advice could be in vain, warned the Telegraph. \"Giant 4x4s or trucks racing though in the opposite direction can create such bow waves they drown your car.\" Aquaplaning occurs when there is water on the road surface, you are travelling fast, and the tyres lose their grip. It needn't be deep water. It feels like you're on black ice as you lose steering control, Rodger says. You should ease off on the power. But on no account turn the steering wheel. If you turn the wheel and the tyres suddenly grip again the car can go into a spin, Rodger says. There are two lessons drivers should heed if they aquaplane - you're going too fast and your tyres may be worn. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook",

It is traditional for South Koreans to celebrate the Chuseok holiday in the company of their families with a home-made meal, Songpyeon rice cakes, and ancestral rites. Seoul's Transport Ministry expects more than 35 million people to hit the country's roads as the holiday season kicks off next week.

Thompson Aero Seating saw pre-tax profits rise by 27% to almost \u00a314m in the year ending March 2016.

He says his protest is about police refusing to crack down on a drug and prostitution ring - police deny this. His anti-corruption Aam Aadmi Party has demanded more control over police. Mr Kejriwal took over as Delhi's chief minister earlier this month after his party won 28 of the 70 seats in recent elections on a pledge to fight corruption and clean up politics. But Delhi's police force is run by the federal government and so Mr Kejriwal was on his way to the home minister's office to demand the suspension of a number of policemen. \"We want all the people of Delhi to come here to protest against Delhi police,\" Mr Kejriwal said, adding that he and his supporters planned to continue their demonstration against police. He accused the police of taking bribes from rickshaw drivers for minor offences, but doing little to fight lawlessness. Indian Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said a judicial inquiry on the role of the police had been ordered into the alleged incident involving a drug and prostitution ring and that Mr Kejriwal \"should wait for its result\" before protesting. Vigilante accusations Monday's protest was prompted by an incident last week when the Aam Aadmi Party became embroiled in a bitter row with police and members of Delhi's African community, that threatened to become a diplomatic issue. Last Wednesday Mr Kejriwal's Law Minister, Somnath Bharti, and various party supporters allegedly confronted four Ugandan women in a Delhi neighbourhood accusing them of prostitution. Media reports said a row erupted when police refused to search a nearby house for evidence of a suspected drugs and prostitution racket because they did not have a warrant. Mr Bharti and Aam Aadmi Party supporters were accused of threatening and intimidating the women, forcing their way into homes and making racist remarks. They deny allegations that they behaved like vigilantes and Mr Kejriwal told the Hindustan Times newspaper that this was not a \"diplomatic issue. We are not against any race or country. We are against anti-social elements\". Nevertheless India's foreign ministry said in a statement over the weekend that the \"incident was utterly condemnable\" and assured ambassadors of some 20 African nations that authorities were not targeting their citizens. But Mr Kejriwal says his protest encompasses more grievances than the latest confrontation. His party is also demanding the suspension of a number of policemen - he alleges police refused to take action in one case involving the death of a woman, reportedly killed over a demand for dowry by her in-laws. They have also condemned the police for their handling of another case involving the alleged gang-rape of a Danish woman in the city last week - six people have so far been arrested in connection with the attack.",

Army patrols were searching for another police officer, William Donato, who fled during the fighting. The rescue came just days before the second round of the presidential poll. The rescued men were among the Farc's longest-held captives. It is believed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) are still holding 19 members of the security forces who they want to swap for some 500 jailed guerrillas. Most of the hostages were seized in the late 1990s. Defence Minister Gabriel Silva said 300 men had attacked the camp in Guaviare province with \"surgical precision\" but he acknowledged that Capt Donato had fled during the fighting. \"We have high hopes that he is in hiding and that he will be found in the coming hours,\" he said. He said the rescued hostages, who are due in the capital, Bogota, later on Monday, were being protected by 300 soldiers. 'Birthday present' President Alvaro Uribe said the operation had been planned for several months and that Gen Mendieta, who turned 53 on Sunday, was in good health. Gen Mendieta's daughter, Yenny, told a Colombian radio station she could not believe the news and was looking forward to speaking to her father as soon as possible. His wife, Maria Teresa, said she was the happiest woman in the world. She said she had not known the rescue operation was under way and could not wait to celebrate her husband's birthday with him. Gen Mendieta and Col Murillo were captured on 1 November 1998 when Farc rebels overran Mitu, a town in the far east of the country. Col Murillo's 12-year-old son said he and his mother had cried with joy when they had heard the news on television. He thanked the police. Sgt Delgado has three children. His wife said she was hoping he could make up for the years he had missed with them. President Uribe told reporters a soldier had died in the operation. The rescue was the highest-profile mission since July 2008, when French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and three Americans were freed from rebel hands.

Workers at Remploy's 54 factories voted in May to go on strike in protest at the planned closures. Phil Davies, national officer of the GMB union, said: \"To close these factories that employ disabled people in the present economic climate is a sentence to a life of unemployment and poverty. \"The strikes will go ahead on July 19 and 26 as planned and should be a rallying point, giving for each local community the opportunity to stand behind these disabled workers who will be facing the scrapheap.\" The government has set aside \u00a38m to support workers who are made redundant.

Remploy factories were established in 1945 to give employment opportunities to disabled people. Enterprises range from furniture and packaging manufacturing to recycling electrical appliances. The closures follow recommendations by an independent review into the way the government spends its disability employment budget. It recommended that the government should divert funding to support individuals, rather than subsidising factory businesses. The 27 Remploy factories to close are: Acton, Ashington, Barking, Birkenhead, Bolton, Cleator Moor, Gateshead, Leeds, Leicester, Manchester, Newcastle, North London, North Staffordshire, Oldham, Penzance, Pontefract, Preston, Southampton, Spennymoor, Wigan, Worksop, Aberdare, Abertillery, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea, Wrexham and Wishaw, plus operations at Boston Spa.

Any reading above 50 indicates growth while a reading below 50 points to a fall in activity. Markit said the survey pointed to first-quarter economic growth of 0.3%. That would match the eurozone growth figure for the final three months of 2014. It said the improvement in business output was the result of growth in new orders that had increased at their fastest rate since 2011. Employment also grew at its fastest rate since August 2011. Job creation in the service sector \"held steady\" near February's four year high, Markit said, while in the manufacturing sector it grew at its quickest pace since April last year. Crucially, the survey showed that deflationary pressures eased in March with prices falling at the slowest rate since July. Markit said this reflected the need for some firms to pass on costs to customers Upturn It added there was some anecdotal evidence that the European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus measures were beginning to be felt. Manufacturing prices rose for the first time in seven months, albeit only modestly. Meanwhile, in the service sector, prices fell, but the rate of decline was the weakest for nine months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit, said the survey results indicated some impetus from the ECB's economic stimulus programme, which began at the start of the month, although it was coming \"at a time when there was already growth\". He added: \"All the indicators are pointing to a further upturn, firms are taking on staff and it augurs well for the year ahead.\" Separate PMI surveys for Germany and France, the eurozone's two largest economies, were also released. Business activity in Germany rose to to its highest level in eight months as new orders hit a nine-month record. German factory output was its highest for nearly a year catching up with the strong pace of growth in the service sector, which hit a six-month high. The French economy also saw business activity increase for a second month, although at a slightly more modest pace than in February, when it hit a 42-month high. Business output in France is still running well below that of Germany. However, new orders were at their highest level sine August 2011. But French manufacturing output fell for the tenth month in row. Howard Archer chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight called the latest PMI \"highly encouraging\" adding the improvement in manufacturing activity was welcome. \"It is not just the headline figures that are encouraging but the whole tone of the surveys. Eurozone economic activity is strengthening as very low oil prices, a weak euro, major ECB stimulus and much reduced fiscal headwinds foster an improved growth environment,\" he added.",

Fox hunting is banned in Scotland, but dogs are still allowed to flush out foxes for pest control. Three charities have organised a march next month in Edinburgh to highlight the issue. The bid is led by the League Against Cruel Sports, OneKind and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). The Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act in 2002, effectively banned fox hunting with dogs, with an exemption for using them to flush out foxes for pest control or protecting livestock or ground-nesting birds. Mounted hunts in Scotland have since offered farmers, landowners and estate managers a pest control service, but a review by Lord Bonomy found there were \"grounds to suspect\" fox hunting takes place illegally and he recommended having independent monitors to police hunts. The charities believe the Act is \"insufficient\" and have been campaigning for it to be improved to close \"loopholes\" that allow for traditional hunting. The League Against Cruel Sports has also released video footage it claims shows Scottish hunts \"causing panic\" among flocks of sheep. Mr Gervais said: \"It is utterly sickening that the primitive, horrific pastime of chasing foxes with packs of hounds is still happening routinely in this country with little or no means of bringing to justice those who inflict such cruelty on wildlife. \"The Scottish government has an opportunity to make this appalling 'sport' go away so it's high time it stopped dragging its feet and got on with improving the law to ban fox hunting once and for all.\" Mr Packham added: \"It is quite staggering that in this day and age we live in a country where people go out with the intention of terrorising wild animals by chasing them to the point of exhaustion and brutally killing them. \"Sadly in Scotland the law has proven not to be sufficient to stop this horrific behaviour. \"I wholeheartedly support the League Against Cruel Sports and OneKind in their campaign calling on the Scottish Government to strengthen the law to make sure fox hunting is really banned in Scotland. \"Fox hunting has no place in modern society and now is the time to put it firmly where it belongs - in the past.\" The Scottish Government has consulted on Lord Bonomy's recommendations with analysis currently under way on the responses.",

A local baker hopes to raise \u00a31m to turn it into a tourist attraction. Geraint Jones, who owns Becws Islyn bakery in the village, has transferred the mill to a community group in the hope it can be grinding grains again by 2023. Mr Jones said: \"It could easily have been turned into anything, but we wanted to keep the history of Aberdaron as it was. \"The plan is hopefully we can grow our own wheat, we can grind it here and bake it in the bakery.\" Mentioned in historical documents dating back to 1252, Melin Daron was one of five mills owned by the Abbey on Bardsey Island. At that time, grain was transported from the island to be ground and the flour then carried back to Bardsey. When the mill closed in the 1950s the building fell into disrepair, with the outer shell - dating back to the 19th Century - deteriorating. Project director Roy Milnes said the group had managed to attract enough funding to safeguard the mill over the winter before work could begin to turn it into a tourist and education facility. \"It's a valuable asset and Grade II listed building - we want to develop this area of the village to bring more people in out of season,\" he said \"Most of the mills in the area have been stripped out, but this mill is complete, worn out but complete, and so it's restorable.\" Mr Milnes said the hope was to teach school children how to make bread, and to bring more tourists into the village out of season. \"There's a whole language associated with milling that has gone with the past, we want to bring all of that back and get people familiar with the operation of the mill - and hopefully end up with bread,\" he said.

Pope Francis takes over from Benedict XVI, who abdicated last month. The former Argentine cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 76, was the surprise choice of cardinals meeting in Rome to choose a new head of the Church. In his first audience at the Vatican, he said Jesus Christ and not the Pope was the centre of the Church, which he stressed was \"spiritual not political\" in nature. He said the Holy Spirit had inspired the resignation of Benedict XVI and guided the cardinals choosing him as the next pontiff. The Pope said he had been inspired to take the name Francis by a Brazilian colleague who embraced him and whispered \"don't forget the poor\" when it was announced that he had been elected Pope. He said he immediately thought of St Francis of Assisi, the Italian founder of the Franciscan Order who was devoted to the poor. As well as representing poverty and peace, he said St Francis \"loved and looked after\" creation - and he noted that humanity was \"not having a good relationship with nature at the moment\". St Francis of Assisi is said to have loved animals as his \"brothers and sisters\" and even to have preached to birds.

The fossil consists of two rows of imprints that represent the earliest known record of an animal with legs. The research by a Chinese team appears in Science Advances journal. Team-members are unclear whether the creature had two legs or several. But they say the tracks probably belong to a bilaterian. This is a group of animals characterised by having paired appendages - in this case, perhaps, paired legs. They are one of the most diverse animal groups in existence today. These legs raised the animal's body above the sediment it was moving across. The trackways were found in the Yangtze Gorges area of South China. The rocks they come from are dated to between 551 million and 541 million years old. \"Previously identified footprints are between 540 and 530 million years old. The new fossils are probably up to 10 million years older,\" the study's co-author Zhe Chen, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told AFP. He added: \"At least three living groups of animals have paired appendages (represented by arthropods, such as bumblebees; annelids, such as bristle worms; and tetrapods, such as humans). \"Arthropods and annelids, or their ancestors, are possibilities.\" The animal appears to have paused from time to time, since the trackways seem to be connected to burrows that may have been dug into the sediment, perhaps to obtain food.",

Current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is not immune either - cartoons ridicule his looks and prominent nose. His falling out with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei may have something to do this. So it came as a surprise when a cartoonist was recently sentenced to 25 lashes for publishing a caricature of a right-wing MP from Iran's Central Province. Mahmoud Shokrayeh's cartoon of Ahmad Lotfi Ashtiani appeared in the Nam-e Amir journal, published in the central city of Arak. It showed the MP wearing a football kit in the middle of a pitch with one arm on his waist, holding an award certificate in one hand and with his foot on a football. A number of Iranian politicians have recently been criticised for interfering in sports. 'Cruel' punishment Other Iranian cartoonists were quick to come to Shokrayeh's defence. Mana Neyestani condemned the sentence on his colleague as \"cruel and uncivilised\". He went on to call on others to publish more cartoons of the MP in solidarity with Shokrayeh. Other reactions followed. Prominent journalist and blogger Masih Alinejad published an interview with Esmail Kowsari, a member of the parliament's National Security Committee. She quoted the MP as saying: \"I doubt such a sentence would be issued for just a caricature. An accusation has its own punishment.\" In another post, she wrote: \"Mr MP, a caricature does not mean insult and rudeness.\" Alinejad also praised Mana for his suggestion of more cartoons lampooning the MP. This was followed by the sudden appearance of a number of cartoons lampooning Mr Ashtiani. Cartoonist Jamal Rahmati posted a simple cartoon of the MP, with a caption saying: \"Mr MP, if drawing your cartoon leads to 25 lashes, please come and lash me too.\" Meanwhile, Vahid Nikgoo's cartoon showed Mr Ashtiani looking into a mirror with a speech bubble saying: \"I'll take you to court and sentence you to lashes so that you won't draw me like this any more!\" And comments by Iranians on the Balatarin community website were indicative of the mood. \"If I had the skill, I would draw cartoons of this MP for a whole week and upload them onto the net,\" wrote Majidkhan. \"A plea to all those who can, roll your sleeves up and get drawing!\" \"This poor MP made it worse for himself. If he had kept quiet, no-one would have seen the cartoon. He himself has made it go international!\" said another.

        "input": "By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Using world survey data, the Lancet study authors found life satisfaction followed a predictable trajectory depending on where people lived. In countries such as the UK and the US, life satisfaction followed a U-shape, dipping to a low in midlife. In Africa it was low throughout, and in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and Latin America it declined with age. The reasons behind the trends were multiple and complex, but there were some plausible explanations as well as important lessons to be learned, said Prof Andrew Steptoe, of University College London, and colleagues. Their report is part of a series on health and ageing, published in The Lancet, warning of a growing burden of chronic disease and diminished wellbeing affecting the quality of life of older people. Satisfaction The researchers used four years of data from the Gallup World Poll in more than 160 countries covering more than 98% of the world's population, to make their evaluations. As well as physical health and pain, they considered three measures of wellbeing: In Western world nations, life satisfaction bottomed out between the ages of 45 and 54 before rising again. Co-researcher Angus Deaton, of Princeton University in the US, said economics could explain this. \"This is the period at which wage rates typically peak and is the best time to work and earn the most, even at the expense of present wellbeing, so as to have increased wealth and wellbeing later in life,\" he said. It might explain why elderly people were happier despite becoming more frail - although poorer health led to lower ratings of life satisfaction among the elderly, higher life satisfaction seemed to stave off physical health declines. In transition countries, such as the former Soviet Union, life satisfaction declined steadily with age and was generally lower overall than in the West. This could again be linked to economics, said the researchers. Older people in these countries had lost a system that, however imperfect, had given meaning to their lives, and, in some cases, their pensions and their health care. In sub-Saharan Africa, satisfaction was very low throughout life, while stress and worry was high. \"The findings undoubtedly show the recent experiences of the region and the distress that these events have brought to older people,\" said Prof Deaton. Prof Steptoe said while money did not equate to happiness, economic progress did promote wellbeing to an extent. \"It would appear that wellbeing goes along with economic prosperity in the world,\" he said.",

But mathematician David Hodge said that people would be much less likely to win any other cash prize. This is because under the new rules, the pool of numbers that players have to choose from will increase from 49 to 59. For example, as it stands, people choose six numbers up to 49, and the odds of winning the Lotto jackpot are just under one in 14 million. These odds will lengthen to around one in 45 million when the new changes come in. Increasing the number pool size will roughly halve people's current chance of getting a cash prize - apart from through the Millionaire's Raffle - said Mr Hodge, a lecturer in statistics from the University of Nottingham. \"The chance of winning something monetary is dropping by between 40% and 50%,\" he told the BBC. More winners? Camelot said the new Lotto Millionaire's Raffle \"will guarantee at least two millionaires each week in addition to 20 winners of \u00a320,000 in every draw\". Also, under the changes to the rules, players who match two numbers will win a Lucky Dip ticket for a future draw. Camelot said this will create an \"extra 1.8 million winners each week\".

The remaining jobs will go at the creamery in Chard, which is due to shut by the end of next year. Chief executive Mark Allen said the closures were right for the long-term future of the business. 'Environmentally friendly' Hanworth will remain open for another two years. Its closure is due to reduced demand for milk supplied in glass bottles, with most people opting for milk in plastic bottles. According to Dairy Crest, the proportion of milk sold in glass bottles has fallen from 94% in 1975 to 4% in 2012. However, the food producer said plastic containers were now as environmentally friendly as glass. The creamery in Chard makes a range of alcoholic and retailer-branded creams. Mr Allen said: \"At Hanworth nothing is going to change immediately, but sales of milk in glass bottles are falling and we have to give our employees at Hanworth clarity over the dairy's future. \"We also have to let our milkmen and women know that we are doing all we can to protect their livelihoods.\" He added that the firm had tried to make the Chard site \"viable for many years\" but this had not worked. Production will be stepped up at its three plastic bottling dairies in Chadwell Heath, Greater London; Foston, Lincolnshire; and Severnside, Bristol; to make up for the loss of production at Hanworth.

About eight million of the faulty chipsets, called Cougar Point, have been distributed so far, said Intel. HP, Dell, Samsung and Lenovo have stopped selling some machines built around Cougar Point. The manufacturers said affected customers would get refunds, replacement parts or new machines. Seven models of computer made by Samsung and four by Dell, plus laptops and desktops from Lenovo and HP, have used the faulty chipset. The discovery of the bug has also prompted HP to cancel a mid-February event at which it planned to launch a range of business laptops to be built using Cougar Point. The news about the bug is an embarrassment for Intel as it rolls out its newest batch of processors, called Sandy Bridge. It is chipsets that work with two versions of the Sandy Bridge processors that have been found to be faulty. If left in place, the chipsets could cause hard drives or other storage devices to malfunction. About 5% of PCs using the faulty part would have failed during a three-year period, said Intel. \"It would be a low and continuing failure rate over the life of the systems,\" Stephen Smith, vice president and director of PC Client, told Reuters. Although millions of the faulty chips have been sent out to manufacturers, only about 100,000 had been put into finished systems.

Network Rail say a record number of young people have lost their life on railway tracks this year. To combat a lack of knowledge about the dangers, the rail industry and the British Transport Police have launched a campaign called You vs Train. The campaign highlights the story of Tom Hubbard, who suffered life changing injuries after being struck by 25,000 volts of electricity when he came into contact with the overhead wires which power some trains. Eleven days after the accident, Mr Hubbard says he woke up in hospital \"wrapped from head to toe in bandages, heavily medicated and unable to string a sentence together\". He had suffered third degree burns across 57% of his body and says he is still dealing with the physical and psychological consequences. \"Four years on I'm still affected by the events of that day and every time I look in the mirror I'm reminded by that one decision to go on the railway,\" he said. \"The accident has made me more of an introvert and cautious of trying new things, often opting to stay in during the day to avoid people, and wear hoodies and long-sleeved tops to hide my scars, even on hot days.\" A film re-enacting Tom's story will be shown in cinemas over the summer. In June three young men were killed by a train near a south London railway station. British Transport Police (BTP) said it is believed they were hit by an out-of-service passenger train. In the past 12 months, seven children have died and a further 48 have received life-changing injuries on the railway. Network Rail said the new figures relate to accidental deaths and injuries as a result of trespassing. They do not include railway deaths which have been recorded as suicides by a coroner or incidents related to level crossings. A survey carried out on behalf of Network Rail and the British Transport Police (BTP), suggests there is a lack of knowledge about the dangers of the railways among young people. It found that 15% of 13 to 18-year-olds believed it was safe to walk on the railway track if there were no trains coming. Only 37% deemed the railway to be extremely dangerous and more than half did not believe that sidings were dangerous.

Great Rail Journeys, the York-based tour company which organised the trip, earlier said the families of those killed had been informed. Representatives from the company are due to meet survivors.

Onboard were 36 passengers and a tour manager on day three of a 13-day trip. Confirming the deaths of two British nationals on Saturday, Foreign Office minister for Asia Hugo Swire said he was \"deeply saddened\". Local police said nine people were injured, including six Britons. Three people - two passengers and the tour guide - are still in hospital with what are believed to be non-life threatening injuries, Great Rail Journeys said. Emergency response Chief executive Peter Liney thanked the Foreign Office for its assistance, and said a group of passengers were now in a hotel in the nearby city of Chandigarh. An emergency response team from the company, including a counsellor, had landed in Delhi and was on its way to Chandigarh, expected to arrive about 17:30 local time, he said. \"A number of the passengers have chosen to move on from the hotel in Chandigarh and have gone to Shimla, where Great Rail Journeys will ensure that an experienced tour manager is made available,\" he added. The new tour manager would arrive in Shimla on Monday, he said.

The 24-year-old previously admitted causing grievous bodily harm to Harry, who needed emergency surgery. Judge Julian Lambert told Walters the \"accident\" had been \"grossly irresponsible\". \"It's explicit that you didn't mean to harm him but you took a risk,\" he said. In mitigation, Walters' lawyer told the court his client \"recognised the impact of his reckless act\", adding what he did had \"divided a community and that he is sorry he did something so stupid, he cannot forgive himself for that\". The court was told doctors are still concerned about Harry's seizures and his sight - with 50% in one eye, and 25% in the other. In a statement read to the court, his parents Ed Studley and Amy Allen said Harry \"had difficulty recognising them now\" and that \"he is not such a happy playmate with his brother\". \"Harry's prognosis is not very optimistic,\" they said. The couple have moved home and their lives have been \"drastically changed\" and Mr Studley has had to leave his job to care for Harry. Speaking outside court his parents said \"justice has been seen to be done\" and Jordan Walters \"who caused Harry harm and such serious injuries has been dealt with by the court\". \"Harry's struggles continue and will do for the rest of his life and that cannot be changed. Fortunately we still have Harry in our lives. \"As a family we would like to see changes made to the law so that people who possess high-powered air rifles are made to be more responsible for their actions while at home or elsewhere.\" Upset and crying At an earlier hearing, Walters' partner Emma Horseman was found not guilty of GBH by aiding or abetting the shooting. The court was told Harry lived with his parents and brother in a top-floor flat in Bishport Avenue, Hartcliffe, and Ms Horseman lived on the second floor with Walters and their two children. They had been friends for about six years and their children played together. On the day of the incident Harry's mother Amy Allen had taken him and his brother to the flat and had been sitting on a sofa holding Harry, who was upset and crying, on her lap. Walters then fired the gun at Harry, who was 18 months old, believing it to be empty.",

One large sign read, \"Make Racists Afraid Again\". The march turned violent, with people in black bloc smashing business windows and upending trash cans. A large number of helmeted police with nightsticks moved to drive them away, but many of the marchers ran, continuing to make their way through the streets. Eventually they were corralled together by police and there were reports of arrests. 2. Free weed Members of a Washington group called DCMJ began handing out free marijuana to promote legalisation and protest Trump's pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions. Sessions famously once said that \"good people don't smoke marijuana\", and at his confirmation hearing would not commit to not enforcing the federal ban on marijuana in states that have legalised it. Small amounts of marijuana are free to posses and distribute in Washingon, DC. DCMJ members passed out rolled joints from inside a fake prison cell, draped with a sign that read \"Jeff Sessions is Backwards on Marijuana\". 3. Blocking inauguration check points Several groups including Black Lives Matter, environmentalists, LGBT rights activists and many others staged sit-ins that blocked revellers from check points leading to the inauguration. Some demonstrators even chained themselves to gates. Trump supporters were still able to gain access to the Inauguration through other checkpoints. 4. Democrats sport matching Affordable Care Act buttons Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats will be wearing matching blue buttons that say #ProtectOurCare, a reference to the Affordable Care Act, which is under threat of repeal under the new Administration. Pelosi tweeted that the buttons are \"symbol of our solidarity and support for the ACA during today's inauguration\". Several female legislators also plan to wear pink \"pussyhats\" to the inauguration. The knitted hats will be worn by hundreds of protesters at tomorrow's Women's March and are a reference to Trump's vulgar comments about assaulting women. 5. Staying home Many citizens chose to register their protests by sitting out the inauguration. Where crowds packed the parade route and National Mall to watch the swearing in of Barack Obama, there were noticeably empty patches during the Inauguration ceremony. Meanwhile, the DC's transportation authority tweeted out ridership statistics: 193,000 people took the metro today, compared with 513,000 when Obama was inaugurated in 2009 and 317,000 when Obama was inaugurated for his second term in 2013. It was even less than the 197,000 who rode to see George W Bush inaugurated in 2005.

However, in Scotland rates of the cancer were significantly higher than the UK average. More than two 15-34 year old Scots are diagnosed with skin cancer each week. In the past 30 years, rates of the disease north of the border rose from 2.2 cases per 100,000 to 8.2, equating to a 266% increase. The charity said that in Scotland, about 1,090 people of all ages were diagnosed with malignant melanoma every year. The new data is published as Cancer Research UK launched its SunSmart campaign for 2011. Primary school assistant Kellie Boyle was diagnosed with the cancer in 2007. The 26-year-old from Arbroath had been irritated by a small red blemish on her neck. She said: \"I really had no worries about it at all. \"It was more like a little skin tag and the dermatologist didn't think it was anything to worry about. I had it removed and, as far as I was concerned that was the end of that.\" A sample of the blemish was sent to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee for testing where it was found to be cancerous. Ms Boyle said: \"I honestly couldn't believe it when I was told I had cancer. \"I was only 23 and suddenly thought I had been given a death sentence. I was in complete shock. I've never been particularly into sunbathing, and don't use sunbeds, so to be told I had malignant melanoma was completely shocking.\" Ms Boyle was admitted to Ninewells for surgery and had a radical neck dissection and lymph nodes removed and is now cancer free. Caroline Cerny, Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign manager, said: \"It's very worrying to see that the number of young adults being diagnosed with this potentially fatal disease has risen so dramatically, especially since cancer is typically a disease that affects older people. \"With summer approaching after such a harsh winter, everyone is looking forward to enjoying some sunshine. But it's more important than ever to be aware of the dangers of getting sunburnt.\" Ms Cerny said young women in particular were prone to the condition as they were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with melanoma than young men. The dramatic rise in skin cancer is directly related to people's tanning behaviour, a trend which began in the 1970s with the dawn of cheap package holidays.",

Almost two-thirds of pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds. It is a successful school, rated good by Ofsted, which aims high academically, promotes sport and keeps class sizes small But from September next year, the school is due to lose almost the maximum amount possible under the Fairer Funding Formula. The maximum cut under fairer funding is capped at 3% and, according to head teacher Karen Rixon, Rendell is due to lose 2.8% - the joint highest in the county, despite by no means being the best funded. This amounts to about \u00a334,000, equivalent to at least one teacher's salary, Mrs Rixon told BBC News. She describes the cut as \"pretty shocking\", particularly as, she says, schools in other more affluent areas of Leicestershire, will see their budgets rise by up to 8%. \"The biggest thing for me is the reality that schools that are funded by huge amounts more than us are not going to be losing out,\" said Mrs Rixon. \"There is not going to be a redress of balance.\" The school is already under major pressure, as funding has failed to keep pace with increased staff costs, such as increased pension contributions and pay rises, said Mrs Rixon. She said the school was looking at ways to cope with the loss in funding. \"If we lose a teacher it will push class sizes over 30,\" she explained. \"Whereas some schools can raise significant amounts of money to enrich facilities in schools, Rendell is very much reliant on government funding for everything it provides, including enrichment activities. \"It is these things we will have to cut back on first to protect the jobs of teachers and support-staff,\" she added.

It marks the firm's latest effort to keep users loyal to the platform ahead of the much-delayed release of the Blackberry 10 operating system. The Blackberry 10 system is due to launch on 30 January, with the first devices running it available the following month. Teen-friendly BBM has previously been able to send voice notes. And other Blackberry apps - such as TringMe and MobileVoip - already offer access to free calls.

Dignitaries will descend on site for a glitzy event in July marking 100 years since US explorer Hiram Bingham came upon the site, but the origins of Machu Picchu were far less glamorous. According to a study published in archaeological review Antiquity, llama droppings provided the basis for the growth of Inca society. It was the switch from hunter-gathering to agriculture 2,700 years ago that first led the Incas to settle and flourish in the Cuzco area where Machu Picchu sits, according to the study's author Alex Chepstow-Lusty. Mr Chepstow-Lusty, of the French Institute of Andean Studies in Lima, said the development of agriculture and the growing of maize crops is key to the growth of societies. \"Cereals make civilisations,\" he said. Mr Chepstow-Lusty has spent years analysing organic deposits in the mud of a small lake, \"more of a pond really,\" called Marcaccocha on the road between the lower-lying jungle and Machu Picchu. His team found a correlation between the first appearance of maize pollen around 700BC - which showed for the first time that the cereal could be grown at high altitudes - and a spike in the number of mites who feed on animal excrement. They concluded that the widespread shift to agriculture was only possible with an extra ingredient: organic fertilisers on a vast scale. In other words, lots of llama droppings. Llamas' legacy Llamas were and still are commonly used in the Peruvian Andes to carry goods and provide meat and wool. Marcaccocha is situated next to an ancient trade route, and llamas transporting goods between the jungle and the mountains would stop to have a drink and \"defecate communally\". \"This provided fertiliser which was easily collectable as today by the local people for the surrounding field systems,\" Mr Chepstow-Lusty said. As the Incas moved from eating wild quinoa to maize, which is higher in calories, their society developed in the Cuzco area. Some 1,800 years after they first moved from hunter-gathering to agriculture, around 1100AD, a bout of prolonged warmer weather allowed the civilisation to really flourish, leading to the building of large stone settlements like Ollaytaytambo and Machu Picchu. Today, the Incas are long gone, largely wiped out by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. But their descendants, the Quechua, still use llama droppings for fertiliser and cooking fuel. \"The valley is full of indigenous people who follow that way of life from 2,000 years ago,\" said Mr Chepstow-Lusty. When the guests arrive in Machu Picchu to celebrate 100 years since Hiram Bingham brought it to the world's notice, they can perhaps thank the humble llama for the sight they see before them.",

IXScotland is expected to reduce internet \"lag\" time by up to 75%. Currently most of Scotland's internet traffic goes through London, Manchester or Leeds, which can result in delays. IXScotland, which is based at the Pulsant data centre in Edinburgh, was set up by the London Internet Exchange (Linx). Announcing the new IXP, Finance Secretary John Swinney said the move would allow internet service providers to securely pass traffic to each other in Scotland. He added: \"Along with our investment in next-generation broadband and measures to increase digital participation, this investment represents a further step on Scotland's journey to becoming a world leading digital nation by 2020. \"Central to this will be development of future-proofed infrastructure that supports high quality connectivity on any device, anywhere, at any time.\" 'Step forward' Linx chief executive John Souter said IXScotland was \"a real step forward\" for the internet community in Scotland and the UK as a whole. He added: \"The exchange will allow networks to stop 'tromboning\" traffic to London and back again, and will help increase resilience by creating a new centre for interconnection in the UK.\" The announcement came as the Scottish government released its second annual digital strategy progress report and update. The report outlines progress made in the last year across all four main strands of the government's digital strategy.

Last week, Navalny started a hunger strike to demand proper treatment for acute back and leg pain. The White House said reports that his health was worsening were disturbing. Mr Kobzev, who visited Navalny on Wednesday, said on Twitter (in Russian): \"Alexei is walking himself. He feels pain while walking. It is very concerning that the illness is clearly progressing in terms of losing sensation in his legs, palms and wrists.\" Earlier this week, Navalny, 44, was moved to a sick ward in the prison in the town of Pokrov with symptoms of a respiratory illness. He had complained of a persistent cough and temperature. His temperature was oscillating and had fallen to 37C (98.6F) on Wednesday after reaching 39C (102F) on Monday, according to the lawyer, who said Navalny was losing 1kg (2lbs) a day due to a hunger strike. In an Instagram post, Navalny said prison authorities were trying to undermine his hunger strike by roasting chicken near him and placing sweets in the pockets of his clothes. Also on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration considered Navalny's imprisonment \"politically motivated and a gross injustice\" and called for his immediate release. Earlier, human rights group Amnesty International said Navalny had been incarcerated in conditions that amount to torture and may slowly be killing him. Campaigners say the prison is known for its especially harsh conditions. Navalny's lawyers, who have been visiting him in custody, say there are no doctors at the colony and the medical unit on-site is run by a single paramedic. Last week, Russia's prison service denied Navalny's allegations that he was not receiving proper treatment, saying he had been given \"all the necessary medical assistance in accordance with his medical indications\". On Monday, he said as many as three people from his unit had been taken to hospital with tuberculosis recently, a claim the Russian prison service denied. Navalny was given a suspended sentence for embezzlement in 2014, a conviction widely seen as politically motivated. He was airlifted to Germany for treatment after he was poisoned in Siberia with a Novichok nerve agent. When he returned in January he was immediately taken into custody and a court jailed him for defying the probation terms of the suspended sentence while he was being treated in Germany.",

Its report criticised the government's legal aid changes and said they had \"harmed access to justice\" for some. The Ministry of Justice said legal aid is available where it is needed and the reforms were kept \"under close review\". The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Laspo) removed legal aid from private family law, but those who can provide evidence of domestic violence are still eligible. This evidence must be from no more than two years ago. The committee heard that this requirement \"presented problems for victims\", as a court case could happen long after a relationship breakdown. Clare Laxton, public policy officer at charity Women's Aid, told the committee that some of the most common forms of domestic abuse, including emotional and psychological abuse, are difficult to evidence. 'Barriers to justice' The committee said the Ministry of Justice had failed in three of its four objectives for Laspo. There had been a \"significant rise\" in litigants in person, the Ministry of Justice had \"failed to target legal aid\" to those who need it most, and it had failed to prove that it was better overall value for money, the report said - although savings had been made. Recommendations from the committee included better information from the government on eligibility for legal aid. Committee chairman Sir Alan Beith said while the Ministry of Justice had successfully made savings, this had \"limited access to justice for some of those who need legal aid the most\". He said it was \"vitally important\" the Ministry of Justice remedied this. Jenny Beck, co-chairwoman of the Legal Aid Practitioners Group, said that it was difficult for people in crisis to obtain legal advice because of \"unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles\". \"The cuts to the legal aid system have resulted in barriers to justice for ordinary people,\" she said. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said abuse victims face \"overwhelming challenges\" because of restrictions on legal aid. \"It is unacceptable that victims are left to shoulder the burden of obtaining evidence in order to protect their children or separate from their abuser,\" she said. \"Paying legal aid contributions or meeting evidence requirements that mainly focus on physical abuse create extra barriers to justice for victims of financial abuse.\" A Ministry of Justice spokesman said legal aid was a \"vital part\" of the justice system. \"We protected civil legal aid so it remains available where legal help and advice is most needed,\" he said. \"It is entirely untrue to allege people who are eligible for legal aid under Laspo did not get it. \"We are keeping these reforms under close review and have already made changes to address issues raised. \"We are also undertaking a comprehensive research programme to better understand why people choose to go court and how they deal with legal problems.\"",

Twenty crew were killed when an Argentine Exocet missile hit the 4,100-tonne destroyer, which had 300 people on board, on 4 May 1982. Questions have been raised about the ship's readiness for the attack as the missile was spotted by another destroyer nearby. 'Tears shed' Task force commanders initially dismissed the sighting as \"spurious\", but within seconds disaster had struck. Mr Purcell, a 22-year-old Able Seaman at the time, is today a member of the HMS Sheffield Association. He said: \"The time between spotting the missile and reacting was literally nanoseconds. \"Everything that could have been done in the circumstances was done. \"Thirty years on, there will be lots of stories told and tears shed at the reunion. That's our way of remembering. \"Rather than trying to lay blame for what happened, let's get on with the rest of our lives. \"We will never forget what happened and we will always remember those who lost their lives.\" As the Exocet approached, Mr Purcell had just stepped back on deck to wait for the kettle to boil in the galley below. \"I joined the others back on watch and we glanced out to our right, the starboard side, to see a huge fireball coming towards us. \"There was then a thud into the ship's side and another fireball as it hit. \"The upper deck was covered in huge amounts of thick smoke within seconds.\" The missile apparently failed to explode, but hit deep into the ship's control room, causing poisonous smoke to billow out on to deck. Mr Purcell added: \"It had taken out our main fire main. We were pumping water out of the sea and throwing it straight back on to the super structure to try and put out the flames. \"Two ships eventually came alongside to start fighting the fires, but as the water was being sprayed on the super structure, it was bouncing back into people's faces and was boiling.\" HMS Sheffield was hit while carrying out a scouting mission off Port Stanley in the South Atlantic. It was the first British ship to be lost in enemy action since World War II, and the first of four British ships to be sunk by the Argentine air force in the Falklands conflict. As the fires continued to rage, the burning vessel was abandoned after five hours due to the risk of further explosions. But the lack of damage below the water line meant HMS Sheffield did not sink immediately. It continued to burn fiercely for another two days. A salvage attempt failed and the ship eventually sank while being towed away from the Falklands, almost a week later.",

Reports said the dead man was taking part in the right-wing \"Patriot Rally\". Police said he was not linked to left-wing counter-protests. A Denver TV station said it had hired the suspect to protect its crew, but police have not confirmed this. The suspect is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder. What happened? The \"Patriot Rally\" taking place in Denver was met by counter-protests by several groups who said they were holding a \"Black Lives Matter-Antifa Soup Drive\". The shooting took place in a courtyard of the Denver Art Museum. Photographs published by the Denver Post newspaper appear to show a confrontation during which the demonstrator strikes the security guard and sprays pepper spray at him before the security guard opens fire. Denver Police Chief of Investigations Joe Montoya said the incident took place shortly after 15:30 local time (21:30 GMT). He said there had been a \"verbal altercation\" and a firearm was discharged. Two guns were recovered at the scene and a suspect was taken into custody, he said. Local TV station KUSA-TV said on its website that the arrested man was a security guard it had hired to protect its crew. \"It has been the practice of (KUSA) for a number of months to hire private security to accompany staff at protests,\" the station said.

Aneurin Bevan health board said clinicians were expecting a surge in mental health referrals this winter. The health board is already seeing rising levels of anxiety in those with existing mental health problems. Rhiannon Currie, 36, has seen her anxiety increase throughout the pandemic, which has meant she has sometimes gone without food. \"I feel a lot better when I'm home because I know no-one is going to get me and nothing is going to get me,\" she said. When Ms Currie is hungry, she prefers to order a supermarket delivery to her home and wait for that, which can sometimes take days, rather than leave her home. \"If I decide to go to the shop and I really need to get something I'll psych myself up to go out, or I'll think I don't feel like going out today, I'll go out tomorrow and I keep putting it off,\" she said. Growing Space, which helps people with mental health conditions access food and medication, said it was expecting a wave of people needing help. Too scared to shop The charity operates horticultural therapies across the Aneurin Bevan health board area and is expanding its services to the Cardiff and Vale area because of the level of demand.

The US space agency probe continues to downlink the information gathered during its historic flyby of the dwarf planet on 14 July. As this data arrives on Earth, the team processes it and studies it. A black and white image of the hazes was previously released, showing them to be as high as 130km above Pluto's surface. That picture came from the Lorri camera and was acquired as New Horizons departed the dwarf, looking back to see sunlight skim the edge of the distant world. This new view comes from the Ralph colour camera system. Again, it is taken with Pluto backlit. Like Earth, the dwarf has a predominantly nitrogen atmosphere, albeit much more sparse. But it is the interaction of this nitrogen with the Sun's ultraviolet light, in the presence of another atmospheric constituent, methane, that is able to create the chunky haze particles. \"That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles,\" said New Horizons team member Carly Howett from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. \"A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles. On Earth, those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules. On Pluto they appear to be larger - but still relatively small - soot-like particles we call tholins.\" The principal investigator on the mission, Alan Stern, had teased Pluto fans in recent days, telling them to expect something special from this week's regular Thursday release of new images. \"Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt? It's gorgeous,\" he said in a Nasa statement. If you stood on Pluto and looked straight up, the sky would actually appear black because of the rarity of the atmosphere. \"The haze is pretty thin, so you'd mostly see the colour of the haze as blue sunrises and sunsets,\" Dr Howett explained to BBC News. The other important piece of news to come out concerns the detection of water-ice at many locations on the 2,300km-wide dwarf's surface. More volatile ices tend to dominate the surface, so understanding why the water-ice is seen strongly in some places is an interesting observation that will need to be followed up, the team says. \"We expected water-ice to be there, but we've searched for water-ice in Pluto's spectrum for decades and not seen it before now,\" tweeted Alex Parker, also from SwRI. Since 14 July, New Horizons has moved more than 100 million km beyond Pluto. And this puts it about five billion km from Earth. The vast separation makes for very low data rates. It will be well into 2016 before all the information is on the ground. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

The most common racist hate crimes to take place are criminal damage and assault. Police say around 13% to 14% of all racist hate crimes result in someone being punished. That's around half the rate seen with other crimes.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK without specific hate crime laws. A review of hate crime legislation in Northern Ireland is currently underway. So is Northern Ireland a difficult place to live for ethnic minorities? Chief Supt Bond said: \"We know that nobody is born to hate and nobody is born racist so it must be learned behaviour.\" She said \"education and wider awareness is key\" to ensuring \"ignorance does not manifest itself in attacks happening\". \"For some people, they're facing difficulties,\" she added. \"Whether that's born out of a lack of tolerance, a lack of knowledge, a position of ignorance, the real experiences we hear of on a day to day basis show that there are people suffering significantly within communities just because of who they are, and I think it's incumbent upon us as a police service, and our partners and wider communities, to all play the part that we can to make that come to an end.\"",

It will also insure against three other \"social evils\" - domestic violence, sexual assault and food contamination. There have been several high profile cases of bullying in South Korea in recent years, some of them linked to adolescent suicides. In the event of a successful claim, payments will go towards counselling and medical bills. The policies will be sold to institutions, not individuals. Until now, the company says, it has been difficult for victims to get compensation, even when complaints have been widely reported against perpetrators. The new insurance policies are linked to a campaign launched by South Korean President Park Geun-hye, to root out the four social problems. Analysts say that South Korea's rapid economic rise has led to new social pressures, along with high rates of depression and suicide. Hyundai Insurance says it does not expect to make a profit from the new scheme. \"This is for the public good\" a spokesman said, \"and we're expecting a lot of claims\". Monthly premiums would be a maximum of 20,000 won ($18; \u00a311), but the FSC said it would raise joint funds with municipalities to pay premiums for those unable to afford them. According to a survey conducted by the Education Ministry last year, more than 77,000 school students of all ages said they had been bullied, with nearly 10% of those saying they had considered suicide.

A government spokesman said the outcome was binding \"politically and legally\", but the opposition said the government did not have the support it needed. Mr Orban urged EU policymakers to take note of the result and said he would change Hungary's constitution to make the decision binding. The controversial EU plan to relocate 160,000 migrants across the bloc would mean Hungary receiving 1,294 asylum seekers. Ferenc Gyurcsany, leader of the opposition Democratic Coalition, said the low turnout showed that most people did not support the government. \"According to this result with such low turnout, the people do not support the government. And this is good.\" There were 220,000 spoilt ballots. The number rejecting the EU scheme was 3.3 million, while 55,000 backed it. But a government spokesman said the result could not be regarded as invalid. \"The government initiated the referendum, so both politically and legally the outcome is binding,\" he said. \"The 50% would have made a difference because parliament could have no alternative but to make a decision. But parliament is behind the government regarding the decision. This is a reinforced mandate for the government.\" Analysis - BBC News Europe editor, Katya Adler The referendum result is both a crushing defeat and an emphatic victory for Hungary's prime minister. On the one hand, Viktor Orban led a prominent, expensive and relentless anti-EU and anti-migrant referendum campaign but failed to persuade most Hungarians to vote. On the other hand, those who did vote sided with him almost unanimously, allowing him to trumpet that a higher percentage of Hungarians voted against EU migrant quotas than voted for EU membership 13 years ago. Mr Orban says he is leading what he calls a counter-revolution against EU centralisation, a pushback against Brussels bossiness. He views himself as the man of the moment, speaking for the people of Europe. He had hoped other countries would follow suit and hold their own referendum on migrant quotas. In fact other EU countries are simply ignoring the quotas. What Hungary's prime minister is not calling for is \"Huxit\" - a Hungarian exit from the EU. Mr Orban is all too aware the his economy relies on EU subsidies. During last year's migrant crisis, Hungary became a transit state on the Western Balkan route to Germany and other EU destinations. In an effort to curb the influx, it sealed its border with Serbia and Croatia. The measure was popular at home but criticised by human rights groups. Voters were asked: \"Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?\" The EU proposal was meant to ease pressure on Greece and Italy, the main entry points for migrants and refugees into the bloc. In December Hungary filed a court challenge against the EU plan, which would see relocations over two years.",

The EIS announced plans for a strike ballot on Saturday and now the SSTA's salaries committee is recommending a similar ballot if councils reject a proposed improved offer next week. The Scottish government says it is prepared to fund an improved pay offer but this is short of the 10% rise. It proposes a deal which would see teachers get a 9% rise between January 2018 and this April followed by a 3% rise next year. Councils will decide whether to go ahead with this offer at a meeting next Friday at the council umbrella body Cosla. The general secretary of the SSTA, Seamus Searson, said that if the union held a strike ballot, the timescale would be similar to that planned by the EIS. The EIS plans to ballot in February and could take action in March. Mr Searson said there was a frustration that Cosla seemed reluctant to move to make a new offer as soon as possible.

These are substantial challenges, but they are not the most important issue when it comes to considering people's actual experience of the economy. That comes down to the relationship between people's incomes and inflation - the rise in prices. If inflation is above the rate of increase in wages, then people are suffering an incomes squeeze. As the graph shows, this has been true since January last year. Practically, it means that people are, on average, becoming poorer month by month as the cost of living increases. This has been the situation for the majority of years since the financial crisis and is one of the most fundamental economic changes ushered in by that global calamity a decade ago. Reversing it matters. If consumers' incomes start rising in real terms then confidence is likely to increase and growth is likely to be given a boost. Don't forget that consumer spending accounts for about 60% of UK economic activity. Inflation spike The inflation drop today suggests that the pay squeeze is easing. Incomes data do lag prices, but if the trends continue (inflation easing and wages increasing) then it is likely that many millions of people will see their real incomes start rising again by the end of the year. Which is much better news than we have had recently, particularly after the inflation spike which followed the Brexit referendum and the fall in the value of the pound. That increased import prices of things like food and fuel, which pushed up costs here. That does not mean Britain's incomes problem is over. As the latest Resolution Foundation report, The Living Standards Outlook, revealed, the last decade has seen the most anaemic rates of wage growth for 200 years. Before the financial crisis, average wage growth topped 4%. Since 2009 it has been below 3%. And benefits for those in work have also been cut. Yes, there have been increases in things like the National Living Wage, but the government is well aware that, overall, the picture on incomes is pretty gloomy. Movement Mr Micawber was about right when he observed in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield: \"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen [pounds] nineteen [shillings] and six [pence], result happiness. \"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.\" The moment when the former becomes more likely to be true rather than the latter moved a step closer today.",

The complaint challenged tariffs enacted in June and September of 2018 on goods estimated at more than $200bn in annual trade. The US said the duties were a response to China's state-sanctioned technology theft, subsidies and other \"unfair practices\" and allowed under 1970s-era trade rules. But China said the taxes violated trade regulations because they were higher than US commitments and targeted only one country. A panel of WTO experts agreed with those claims. It added that the US had not proved its case that the tariffs were justified on moral grounds because it did not show how the products affected by the duties had benefited from the unfair practices. \"The panel found, accordingly, that the US had not met its burden of demonstrating that the measures are provisionally justified,\" it said.

The affected apps included a Polish magazine, a gif-sharing service and a platform for sending clips of Xbox games to friends. The BBC has contacted Apple for comment. A message sent to affected developers said that Apple was removing gambling-related apps made by individuals in an effort to \"reduce fraudulent activity... and comply with government requests to address illegal online gambling activity\". Recently, Norway succeeded in getting Apple to ban all gambling apps from its App Store in the country, although the recent removals appear to have been effected worldwide. Some of the removed apps are now coming back online. \"Apple says these apps contain gambling but they don't reveal how they have detected this,\" said Simon Stovring, a Copenhagen-based developer behind a gif-sharing app called Gifferent. \"It seems like an unfortunate but honest mistake,\" he told the BBC. Mr Stovring said about 10 fellow-developers had contacted him to say that they too had been hit by the ban. Wojtek Pietrusiewicz, co-owner of the Polish app iMagazine, said it had also been \"caught in the crossfire\". 'Angry comment' He said he thought the removal might have occurred because the app contains access to the wider internet, which allows users to potentially click through to gambling content. The app, which has thousands of users, was down for a total of 15 hours. While it didn't cause any serious issues, Mr Pietrusiewicz said it did result in \"one angry comment from a reader and a lot of stress for our team\". Another developer, Niall Watchorn, also watched as his app for sharing Xbox game footage was reinstated after several hours. \"It was very frustrating though, as my app has just started gaining traction,\" he told the BBC.",

The village's general store is selling milk in glass bottles and a pub has replaced plastic drinking straws with paper ones. A series of fund-raising activities is planned to finance a poster campaign aimed at raising awareness. Residents launched Plastic-free Aberporth as the UK government's Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, issued his four-point plan for tackling plastic waste. The Aberporth campaign is being led by local resident Gail Tudor, who took part in a fact-finding tour of the British coastline to see the effect discarded plastics were having on marine life and the shore earlier this year. Ms Tudor, a film maker, said: \"I live by the sea and I want to protect the sea and keep it clean and protect the wildlife. \"There is so much plastic in the sea and on the beaches and when it breaks down into microplastics it can get into our food chain. \"We are not going to get rid of plastic altogether. \"Plastic does have some uses, but what we are looking to do is get rid of single-use plastic such as straws and coffee cups.\" Local pub The Ship has already ditched throwaway plastic products like straws, condiment sachets and milk containers. Oliver Box, whose family run the pub, said: \"One thousand plastic straws cost just \u00a31, while the same number of paper straws is \u00a310. We are putting a jar on the bar where we hope customers will contribute in a small way to what we are trying to do. \"We need the financial support of the local community to support the campaign to banish plastic from the village.\" Mr Box said he was \"appalled\" at the sight of discarded plastic strewn along the Wales Coast Path, which runs through the village. He said he and his children Finley, 10, and Florence, six, regularly litter-pick on the public path. \"The campaign can only be a good thing if it gets people thinking about their environment,\" he said. A cafe in the village, Cwtch Glanmordy, has pledged to use wooden cutlery instead of plastic and has invited customers to bring their own mugs for hot drinks. The village shop, London House Stores, has introduced milk in glass bottles and is recycling the empties. Owner Mike Allen said: \"This will put our name on the environmental map. I am proud of what we are doing. \"We need to change attitudes of a disposable society generation.

The move sparked an angry reaction from the arts community - including actor Alan Cumming and playwright David Greig - who feared the new scheme was unsustainable and unlikely to be delivered in time. Now, in a partial climbdown, Mr Dixon and Creative Scotland chairman Sir Sandy Crombie have written to every arts organisation affected to apologise. They said: \"While we remain committed to the strategic direction, we acknowledge that some adjustments would be beneficial. \"The concerns have substantially, although not entirely, been about the speed of the change, which has been over-ambitious and we apologise that this has inadvertently caused anxiety among a number of arts organisations regarding their future. \"We accept that some of our communication on future funding has not been as clear as we would like.\" Although Creative Scotland will still go ahead with its strategy - which coincides with a \u00a32m drop in government funding - it will delay the deadline for applications for six months, allowing organisations extra time for paperwork and to source alternative funding. Organisations and individuals who took to Twitter to protest have welcomed the apology and the acknowledgment of the need for better communication.

The pilot, led by Southampton University, will run for four weeks. Experts hope a saliva test will be an easier option for people - swabs can be uncomfortable and need to go deep into the nose and throat. The tests are designed to identify if a person is currently infected with coronavirus. Participants in the trial, which will include some university staff and students, will provide weekly saliva samples for lab testing. The kit will be delivered to their home or workplace and then collected by staff working for the trial team or returned to an agreed location. It could potentially spot people who are infected but have no symptoms, yet still risk passing the disease on to others. The trial is in addition to routine coronavirus testing already being offered to NHS staff and any people with symptoms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was grateful to everyone involved in the trial: \"Saliva testing could potentially make it easier for people to take coronavirus tests at home, without having to use swabs. This trial will also help us learn if routine, at-home testing could pick up cases of the virus earlier.\" Anyone who tests positive for the virus will be asked to self-isolate to avoid spreading the infection. The saliva test looks for genetic material of the virus using a technique known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Experts say this can be simpler and faster to carry out than the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing method used to analyse coronavirus swabs. Ultimately, it might be possible to do the testing as well as the sampling at home and get results in under an hour. As well as trialling the Optigene saliva test, the Southampton team are exploring the use of other no-swab saliva-based coronavirus tests with companies including Chronomics, Avacta, MAP Science and Oxford Nanoimaging.

But English wine is nothing new. There is archaeological evidence of Roman vineyards in Hertfordshire. The Roman writer Tacitus is believed to have written in 1 AD that England's climate was 'objectionable', and not at all suitable for growing vines. However, entries in the Domesday Book shows records of vineyards in 42 locations, and wine making continued after the Dark Ages, championed by the nobility and the Royal Family. Today, the Queen continues to endorse British wines. She chose a Ridgeview Estate wine, a sparkling wine grown using classic Champagne vines in Sussex, for her 80th birthday celebrations in 2006. Michael Roberts, chairman of English Wine Producers, said the Royal Family's interest was a coup for the country's vineyard owners.

The ice could become frozen in place over winter or escape into the waters between Greenland and Canada. If the iceberg moves south, it could interfere with shipping, Prof Muenchow said. Cracks in the Petermann Glacier had been observed last year and it was expected that an iceberg would calve from it soon. The glacier is 1,000 km (620 miles) south of the North Pole. A researcher at the Canadian Ice Service detected the calving from Nasa satellite images taken early on Thursday, the professor said. The images showed that Petermann Glacier lost about one-quarter of its 70km-long (43-mile) floating ice shelf. There was enough fresh water locked up in the ice island to \"keep all US public tap water flowing for 120 days,\" said Prof Muenchow. He said it was not clear if the event was due to global warming.

Lawyers argue they face discrimination on the grounds of their gender. The group accuse the government of \"double standards\" because it promotes women's rights. The woman involved in the case are: Lady Willa Franks, eldest daughter of the Earl of Balfour; Lady Eliza Dundas, eldest daughter of the Earl of Ronaldshay; Sarah Long, elder sister to the current Viscount Long of Wraxall; Tanya Field, eldest daughter of the Earl of Macclesfield, and Hatta Byng, eldest daughter of Viscount Torrington. Under the principle of male primogeniture, sons, nephews and uncles take precedence over daughters, nieces and aunts when a title is passed on to the next generation. The five women, who are part of the Daughters' Rights campaign, want the UK government to remove the word \"male\" from legislation they describe as \"outdated\" so they can stand for by-elections to the Lords. There are about 800 members of the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament. The House of Lords Act 1999 saw most hereditary peers lose their right to a seat, but 92 still sit in the chamber and when their positions become vacant a successor is elected. While some hereditary titles can be inherited by women because of the rules surrounding the way they were originally created, all but one of 92 current hereditary peers are male. The Daughters' Rights campaign says the system breaches Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, when taken alongside Article 3 of the First Protocol, the right to a free election. Downton Abbey law New rules on royal succession came into force in 2015 to remove male bias, meaning that Princess Charlotte is currently fourth in line to the throne. In 2013 the Equality (Titles) Bill was introduced in the Lords with a view to allowing for equal succession of female heirs to hereditary titles and peerages but it was voted down. That proposed change became known as the Downton Abbey law after the ITV drama series carried a storyline where the Earl of Grantham's title passed to a distant relative he had never met, instead of one of his three daughters. UK courts do not have oversight over the rules governing parliamentary procedure. Solicitor Paul Hardy, from law firm DLA Piper which is bringing the case, said the application to the European Court of Human Rights \"raises profound questions about sexual equality and membership of the House of Lords\".

Mr Derbyshire said the council is looking at different ways to improve recycling rates, including consultations with residents about the best ways to get more people involved and restricting the amount of non-recyclable waste people can throw away. It is believed the only way to get residents to recycle more is to cut the frequency of general waste collections - it is currently every fortnight - or limit the number of bags or size of bin. The council might have to consider bringing in unpopular kerbside sorting recycling - where residents separate the different types of material - which a survey found fewer than 4% of people were in favour of.

The bailout \"was subject to a number of conditions\", the report said, \"including maximising revenues, minimising costs, investing in walking and cycling schemes through the new Streetspace for London plan, and an accelerated ramping up of services back to normal levels earlier than planned\".

The measurement puts 68% of those in families where no-one works in poverty and 9% in families where adults work full-time. The government said it offered \"further insight\" into a \"complex\" issue. It currently measures poverty by looking at a person's income compared with the rest of the country, and compares present incomes with salaries earlier in the decade to see how they have changed over time. The SMC says as well as costs, the new measure takes into account the positive impact of access to liquid assets, such as savings. It also takes steps to include groups of people who have been left out of poverty statistics before, such as those living on the streets or in overcrowded housing. The organisation has developed the measure over the last two-and-a-half years. Chair of the SMC, Baroness Philippa Stroud, said groups needed to come together when looking at how to measure poverty. \"The need for an independent commission was clear,\" she said. \"For too long it has been possible to have a debate about the measurement of poverty. \"Now I call on people and organisations across, and outside of, the political spectrum to support this new measure of poverty so that we can all put our energy into creating the policies and solutions that build pathways out of poverty.\" UK variations The latest study from the SMC shows there are 2.5 million people in the UK who are less than 10% above the poverty line, which means small changes in circumstances could see them fall below it. But the SMC said there was good news from their metrics too, with far fewer pensioners living in poverty than was previously thought thanks to a \"significant fall\" in pensioner poverty over the last 15 years. The poverty rates varied significantly across the UK though. The lowest rates were in Scotland - almost 3% lower than the UK's overall figure of 22% - and the highest were in Wales - around 24%.

It could mean that more state schools switch from the long six week summer holidays. The Department for Education said terms should be decided by \"heads and teachers who know their parents and pupils best\". Head teachers warned that parents with children in different schools would still expect local schools to agree common dates so that families could plan holidays together. Schools can already vary the shape of the school day, but from September 2015 they will also be able to change the length of their terms. Labour's education spokesman Stephen Twigg announced last month that a future Labour government would extend these academy flexibilities to all state schools. It means that both the coalition government and opposition are pushing for greater powers to be devolved to individual schools. Summer holidays The plans put forward in the Deregulation Bill would mean that schools that are not academies would not have to accept the term dates set by local authorities. A majority of secondary schools are now academies, but most primary schools have not adopted academy status - so this would represent an extra level of flexibility for them. They would still have to operate within a legal limit of a minimum of 190 school days each year. The Department for Education gave examples of how this might be applied. In Leeds, the David Young Community Academy has a year of seven shorter terms and holidays that are not longer than four weeks. The Boulevard Academy in Hull is going to cut the summer holiday from six weeks to four weeks. \"It is right that all schools are free to set their own term dates in the interests of parents and pupils,\" said a spokesman for the Department for Education. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman said: \"Most schools choose to follow the local authority calendar because they know that it's better for parents who have children in different schools and teachers who want their holidays to coincide with their children's. \"The problem will come if no one is responsible for creating a co-ordinated calendar for an area and it turns into a free for all. \"Somebody needs to take the lead locally on deciding term dates and it makes sense for this to be the local authority, even if schools aren't required by law to follow it,\" said Mr Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. Stephen Twigg, shadow education secretary, said: \"Labour announced this very policy two weeks ago.

A warrant has now been issued for bailiffs to seize Greater Anglia (GA) property after it failed to pay him \u00a3350 compensation. GA confirmed it was in a legal dispute with Mr Pochin but could not comment. Mr Pochin, an ecologist, who moved to Halesworth a year ago, said he was considering moving to Ipswich to avoid the delays, which he claims added up to almost 28 hours over 12 months. Between February 2017 and February 2018, he made 550 journeys and recorded 183 delays. According to his figures, the majority of trains were between one and 10 minutes late. Mr Pochin said 26 journeys were late by more than 15 minutes, with the 100-minute delay on a journey last August. GA has a delay-repay scheme, paying out compensation for journeys more than 30 minutes late. Mr Pochin, who corresponded regularly with the firm about the quality of the service, said the 100-minute delay was the last straw. Using the Consumer Rights Act 2016, he paid \u00a335 to lodge a case at a small claims court \"to highlight the regular deficiencies with the service\". Judgement ruling In September, Mr Pochin and the rail company both agreed to mediation to resolve the matter. But after GA failed to provide dates to meet, Mr Pochin applied for a judgement ruling, which he won in December, and the train operator was ordered to pay him \u00a3350. In February, after failing to get this money, Mr Pochin paid \u00a377 for a warrant to be served on GA to seize assets worth \u00a3350. The courts and tribunal service confirmed a warrant had been issued against GA, which will now have to pay the sum or face the bailiffs. GA admitted 23% of delays were \"directly attributable to Greater Anglia due to incidents such as train faults\". A spokeswoman said the lines Mr Pochin travels on were being upgraded by Network Rail in a \u00a368m scheme \"to make the train service more reliable\". The legislation Mr Pochin used gives rail passengers the same legal protection they receive when paying for other goods and services. \"Hopefully, this case will result in train operators making compensation for delays easier to get,\" Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport said. \"However, passengers in general don't want compensation, they want trains that run on time.\" You may also be interested in:",

Producer Oisin Tymon, with whom the altercation took place, is not believed to have filed his own complaint. Interviews are expected to be held with the star and other parties next week, and the show has been taken off-air. Clarkson has expressed regret over the incident, which his co-presenter James May labelled \"a bit of a dust-up\". An online petition calling for the star's reinstatement - set up by political blogger Guido Fawkes - has accrued more than 800,000 signatures since Tuesday. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Clarkson said he is \"very grateful to everybody\" who has signed the petition. Top Gear is one of the BBC's most popular and profitable TV shows, with an estimated global audience of 350 million. Its success is largely attributed to the contentious host, who has appeared on the show since 1988. Politicians on all sides have weighed into the affair, with Prime Minister David Cameron - a friend of Clarkson - saying he hoped the incident could be \"sorted out\". \"It's a great programme and he's a great talent,\" he said. A lawyer for Mr Tymon said his client \"intends to await the outcome of the BBC investigation and will make no comment until that investigation is complete\". Pre-emptive Clarkson's approach to BBC bosses suggests he was trying to pre-empt any official complaint. The incident, at a Yorkshire hotel, is reported to have been witnessed by members of the public, as well as some of the production team. The presenter, 54, was given what he called his \"final warning\" last May after claims he used a racist word during filming. He later apologised for the incident which, although never broadcast, had been leaked to a tabloid newspaper. Last year, Top Gear was also censured by Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules after Clarkson used a derogatory word for Asian people during its Burma special programme. A further incident during shooting in Argentina saw the show's executive producer, Andy Wilman, brand 2014 an \"annus horribilis\" for his team.

Hundreds of thousands of migrants try to reach the EU in risky sea crossings. Mr Kickl said ships would use a \"quick way\" to clarify who was entitled to asylum but he did not give details. Mr Salvini is under investigation in Italy for refusing to let rescued migrants disembark in Italy last month. Prosecutors in Sicily have opened an inquiry into possible illegal confinement, illegal arrest and abuse of power. Outlining his plan at a joint news conference with Mr Salvini on Friday Mr Kickl said that after \"appropriate checks\" on board ship, those migrants entitled to asylum could be brought to the EU while the rest would be taken to \"safe ports\" in third countries. \"You are well looked after on a ship,\" Mr Kickl said, adding that the system would help solve the \"problem of repatriation\". \"Once people have set foot on the continent, you can only remove them with great difficulty and much expense,\" he told reporters. He said EU asylum policy should aim to make it \"impossible to claim asylum except from outside the EU, and that claims be decided outside the EU\". Mr Salvini said he was absolutely in favour of the plan. Italy is one of the main entry points for migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean with the hope of a new life in the EU. However, the Austrian office of the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) condemned the idea. \"This proposal is simply another attempt to distract attention from the real issue, namely the inability of Europe and of Austria's EU presidency to find a sustainable solution to the humanitarian crisis in the central Mediterranean and Libya,\" the group said in a statement. It urged EU leaders to \"put the protection of human life at the centre of their efforts\". Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores. Although many have since left for other countries, some remain. The UN says that more than 1,600 people have lost their lives trying to cross into Europe in 2018, despite overall numbers being down.

Due to a lack of interest from developers and the continued failure to find a viable use for the former school, the council revealed plans to demolish the buildings earlier this year and carried out a consultation. Almost 91% of the 350 responses agreed that demolition was the best way of bringing the site back into use, and more than 60% describing the site as an eyesore. A design and access statement linked outlined the \"significant public benefits\" from the demolition plan. These included \"the removal of a major eyesore and source of environmental, economic and social blight\" and subsequent improvements from redeveloping the site as a pocket park. The report said the factors were \"sufficient to outweigh the harm resulting from the loss of these designated heritage assets.\"",
        "output": "Plans to demolish an \"eyesore\" derelict school in County Durham have been approved by council planners, despite it being a listed building."

Afterwards, Bieber said: \"I was honoured to meet everyone from the choir and I'm really happy that they got their number one.\" Their new charity single is also aiming for Christmas number one, with proceeds to be split between NHS Charities Together, which represents more than 230 NHS charities, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Charity. Bieber said he was \"humbled to team up\" with the singers. Choir member Pamela Lutalo, who worked on a 30-bed Covid ward this year, said Holy was \"a song of appreciation to families, friends, colleagues and community who have provided encouragement and support to people during the pandemic\". Mike Corr, a former immunisation clinical co-ordinator, added: \"The message that holding someone is such a special thing that it's almost a holy experience is so resonant with current difficulties and personal challenges. \"There are some special people I miss terribly and I hear them say, 'Hold me, hold me,' when all this is over.\" Holy is not the only song vying for this year's UK Christmas number one, which will be unveiled on BBC Radio 1 on Christmas Day.

They believe that the establishment is not above fixing the vote to thwart the democratic will of the electorate. The run up to the referendum has seen the rise of the hashtag #usepens which urges people to reject the traditional pencils supplied at polling stations and instead use a pen to mark their cross on the voting paper. The thinking behind this is that it will then be impossible for some unknown hand to use an eraser to rub out your cross and make another mark in the other box. The hashtag seems to reflect the sentiment captured in a YouGov poll which suggested 46% of Leave voters thought it likely that the EU referendum would be rigged. However, some on the other side of the argument in the Remain camp, clearly regard the thinking behind #usepens as an absurd conspiracy theory and that those who advocate it are members of the tin hat brigade. Why are you given a pencil to vote? The theory of pencils marks being erased in any vote is an old concern. BBC Trending spoke to the Electoral Commission to ask why pencils and not pens are issued in the voting booth. In an email it explained that: \"the use of a pen or pencil when completing the ballot paper is not specified in legislation. In the UK, pencils are traditionally used for the purposes of marking ballot papers and are made available inside polling stations for voters to use. Having said this, there is nothing to stop a voter from using a pen to mark their vote - there is no legal requirement for ballot papers to be marked with a pencil. Pencils have been used partly for historic and partly for practical reasons.\" More information on how to vote on polling day can be found here.

A request by Conservative AM Darren Millar for approval to introduce a private member's bill was defeated 30 votes to 17 on Wednesday. Wales' Environment Minister said he wanted to give the industry \"another opportunity to step up to the plate\". John Griffiths said discarded chewing gum cost local authorities hundreds of thousands of pounds to clear up and contributed to the \"run down feeling of an area\". \"I am firmly of the view that the polluter should pay and that manufacturers should do far more to deal with these issues,\" he said. Under Mr Millar's proposed levy, the money raised would pay for cleaning up discarded gum and anti-litter publicity campaigns. Mr Millar said legislation adding 5p to the cost of a packet of chewing gum sold in shops in Wales would help alleviate a growing litter problem. Rob Peterson, Wrigley senior vice-president and chief innovation officer at its corporate headquarters in Chicago, was among company representatives who met Mr Millar recently in Cardiff. Wrigley head of corporate affairs Sian O'Keefe said: \"We share the frustration that the public often feel in seeing gum litter on the streets. \"But we fundamentally believe that what will change that phenomenon is public education. \"So when people realise that dropping gum on the ground is littering and that they need to do the right thing and put it in the bin that's when we see a reduction in gum litter.\" She said a levy would not work and would \"penalise all consumers, whether or not they dispose of their gum correctly or not\". Some could even see it as a \"licence to litter\" and make the problem worse. The company was working with local authorities and printed messages about responsible disposal on all its packets, she added. Wrigley has also briefed AMs and MPs on progress on developing a \"removable gum base,\" which would be less adhesive and easier to clean. Mr Millar won the opportunity to put his idea forward through a ballot. Speaking before the vote, he said: \"Chewing gum litter is a blight on our streets and costs councils thousands to remove. \"The introduction of a small levy on a packet of chewing gum can help tackle this problem and change the behaviour of those who choose to spit their gum onto our streets.\" Related Internet Links Darren Millar AM Wrigley National Assembly for Wales",

The main bitcoin exchange shut down for 12 hours to install hardware to help it cope with trading volumes. In addition, malicious software is emerging that seeks out and empties the virtual wallets of bitcoin owners. MTGox, on which most bitcoin trading takes place, was overwhelmed earlier this week by the amount of people who joined the exchange to trade the virtual cash. The computer problems prompted a round of panic selling that forced values to plunge. The exchange went offline to beef up its hardware to cope with trading volumes and stem the fall in value. However, soon after trading resumed the site came under a sustained hack attack which saw it bombarded with data. In a tweet, MTGox said the it was being hit by a \"stronger than usual\" attack. It went offline again to avoid the attack and when it re-started, bitcoins continued to fall in value. Early on 12 April each bitcoin was worth about $90 (\u00a358). 'Litecoins' Owners of bitcoins have also become the target of cyber thieves keen to cash in on the boom in the digital currency. A phishing gang posted a message to the discussion forum of a website used by many bitcoin traders saying MTGox was about to start trading \"litecoins\" - an alternative to bitcoins. In the message was a link that supposedly connected to an official MTGox chat site. In fact, the site that people were taken to if they clicked on the link was fake and, via a booby-trapped update file, installed malicious software that then emptied digital wallets of bitcoins. At least one trader was hit in the attack and lost 34 bitcoins as a result. In a post about the theft posted to the Bitcointalk forum, the victim said he was \"stupid\" not to have taken more trouble to stay safe but added: \"This is a serious loss for me, and unless this is handled correctly this can also badly affect the community.\" It has also emerged that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who famously sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claiming they had the original idea for the social network, have substantial bitcoin holdings.

Ben's father Harold, 47, - believed by Devon and Cornwall Police to be responsible - died from burns. The 47-year-old, who had mental health issues, had been asked to move out. 'Broken glass' Forensic scientists told the inquest it appeared Mrs Philpotts died in a flash fire after her badly burned body was found near a petrol can. Mrs Philpotts' mother, who lived with the family, said she had heard an explosion and the sound of broken glass but had been unable to reach her daughter because of thick smoke. The scientists said ten-year-old Ben was found with severe head injuries in his bedroom. A sledgehammer was lying nearby. His father was found outside the property with serious burns and died in hospital eight days later. The inquest heard that Mr Philpotts had previously been admitted to hospital for mental health problems which included depression, delusion and paranoia, but he had discharged himself before treatment. It was said that he had been convinced he had HIV and cancer and had Ben tested for HIV. He had also been asked to move out of the family home due to his behaviour. A serious case review, by the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Safeguarding Children Board published in July said that although Mr Philpotts was known to the authorities to have mental health issues, the death of Ben and his mother could not have been foreseen.

        "input": "By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News Government adviser on health inequality Sir Michael Marmot highlighted data suggesting half of five-year-olds were not ready for school. He said high levels of deprivation and a lack of quality services and support for parents were holding children back. But ministers said investing in the early years was a priority. Since the mid-1990s, the proportion of national wealth being spent on the under-fives has more than doubled, although spending has dropped slightly in recent years. But Sir Michael, who is director of the University College London's Institute of Health Equity and led a ground-breaking review of health inequalities for the government in 2010, said the development of children in England was still lagging behind that of many other Western countries. Figures published last year by the Department of Education indicated 52% of children had \"good development\" at the end of reception year. For those getting free school meals, the figure was 36%. The data is based on a whole range of factors, including emotional, social, physical and academic measures. Children were expected to meet goals such as being able to count to 20, go to the toilet on their own, read and write simple sentences and speak using past, present and future tenses. 'Failure' Sir Michael also reviewed other sources of information covering employment, wellbeing, life expectancy and income. He said while there had been a slight narrowing in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas, serious problems still existed. In particular, he highlighted data indicating nearly a quarter of households were living below the minimum income standards - a rise of a fifth in three years. Sir Michael said the current situation was \"unacceptable\" and represented a \"failure\", as development at aged five was critical in determining an individual's life chances. \"When we first looked at these figures, we assumed there must be something wrong with the measurement. \"How can it be the case in England, one of the richest countries in the world with our long history of being a brainy country, that only 52% of children can have a good level of development?\" He said England had to do more to provide parenting support, such as Sure Start centres, and better access to subsidised child care to allow parents to work and lift themselves out of poverty. \"In looking at children's development, you have got to look at children, parenting, the circumstances in which parenting takes place - the conditions of parents' lives - and the general social context. Good services make a difference,\" he added. A Department for Education spokesman said extra money was being put into early years. \"No child should start school behind their peers. This is why our plan for education is providing flexible, affordable and good quality childcare. \"We are raising the status and quality of the early years workforce by introducing rigorous new qualifications so practitioners are highly skilled and can help all children reach the expected level of development.\"",

He allegedly called journalists the \"enemy of the people\", using a phrase which has been frequently invoked by Mr Trump, who last tweeted it on Thursday. Mr Chain was arrested on Thursday at his home in Encino, California. Police say Mr Chain owned several firearms, and had recently purchased a small-calibre rifle. If found guilty, Mr Chain could receive a sentence of up to five years in prison, and a $250,000 (\u00a3192,000) fine. According to federal documents, Mr Chain first called the paper's newsroom on 10 August after the Globe called upon media outlets to denounce Mr Trump's \"dirty war\" on the press. The Boston Globe had pledged to write an editorial \"on the dangers of the administration's assault on the press\" on 16 August, and asked others to do the same. Mr Trump frequently attacks \"the fake news media\" as the \"opposition party\", and repeated his \"enemy of the people\" line on Thursday: UN experts have warned that Mr Trump's comments about the media raise the risk of violence against journalists. On 16 August, when nearly 350 newspaper answered the Globe's call and published editorials denouncing Mr Trump's attacks on the free press, Mr Chain allegedly called the paper again, this time to say he would shoot employees in the head, \"later today, at four o'clock,\" according to court documents. The threat resulted in a police presence outside the newsroom, in order to ensure employees' safety. Mr Chain allegedly continued to harass the paper's staff, and on 22 August explained his reason for calling. \"Because you are the enemy of the people, and I want you to go [expletive] yourself,\" he is alleged to have said. \"As long as you keep attacking the president, the duly elected president of the United States, in the continuation of your treasonous and seditious acts, I will continue to threats, harass and annoy the Boston Globe.\" He also incorrectly stated that the Boston Globe was owned by the the New York Times, which sold the paper in 2013. The Boston Globe said in a statement it was grateful to law enforcement for taking the threat seriously. \"We couldn't have asked for a stronger response,\" said a representative for the paper. \"While it was unsettling for many of our staffers to be threatened in such a way, nobody - really, nobody - let it get in the way of the important work of this institution.\" Harold Shaw, the FBI's special agent in charge of the Boston Division, said the arrest \"should serve a warning to others, that making threats is not a prank, it's a federal crime\". \"All threats are taken seriously, as we never know if the subject behind the threat intends to follow through with their actions. \"Whether potentially hoax or not, each and every threat will be aggressively run to ground.\"",

He made the prediction as Sainsbury's reported rising food sales in the last three months, including over Christmas. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said grocery sales rose 2.3%, helped by higher food prices. Food prices have gone up, as the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote made imports more expensive. \"We've done everything we can as a business to mitigate that but we can't get away from the fact that food prices are going up,\" Mr Coupe told the BBC. But with that effect wearing off, food price inflation should \"gradually reduce over the next six to nine months\", he said. Christmas shopping Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos, sold 1.1% more in the last three months, as higher grocery sales made up for a 1.4% fall in general merchandise and slower clothing sales. Argos's Fast Track delivery and collection grew strongly over the period, but that was not enough to stop a slide in Argos's sales. \"The general merchandise that Argos sells may be a millstone around the group's neck right now, but longer term the appeal of combining Christmas grocery and gift shopping in one location is clear to see,\" said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The supermarket said it had \"record\" sales over Christmas, as discounted turkeys and other trimmings brought in more shoppers. Sainsbury's now expects pre-tax profits to be slightly higher than the previous estimate of \u00a3559m, helped by higher cost savings from its takeover of Argos.
