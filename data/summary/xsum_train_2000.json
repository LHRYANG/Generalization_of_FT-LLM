I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!",

Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders.\nEven so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe.

Iowa generated 32% of their electricity in 2015 from wind, up from 8% in 2008.\nOn the Paris climate agreement, Mr Obama said this was a \"fundamental shift in the diplomatic landscape which has already yielded substantial dividends\".\nPulling out of the agreement, as Mr Trump has mulled doing, would see the United States lose its seat at the table, and be unable to hold other countries to their commitments, the President wrote. Continued participation in the Paris process, Mr Obama said, would yield great benefit for the American people and the international community.\nHowever, the outgoing president was careful to offer an olive branch of sorts to President-elect Trump. Mr Obama argued that the targets that the US signed up to in the Paris agreement could be achieved in many different ways and \"this does not mean that the next Administration has to follow identical domestic policies\".\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.\nWorkless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.\nPeople may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.\nThe data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.\nThis means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.\nSome 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.\nChildren's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.\nHowever, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.\nThey said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.\nThe proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years.\nIn 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, this figure drops to 224,000.\nMark Hoban, the Minister for Employment, said: \"Helping people off benefits and into work is one of this government's top priorities, so it is good news that the number of workless households has fallen by more than 425,000 since the coalition took office.\n\"By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are better off in work than on benefits, and through schemes such as the Work Programme and Youth Contract we are giving people the support they need to get a job and fulfil their aspirations of looking after themselves and their families.\"\nStephen Timms, Labour's shadow employment minister, said: \"Any fall in worklessness is welcome, but the truth is Britain's unemployment crisis is far from over.\n\"Underemployment is at record highs, long-term unemployment is at its highest level for 17 years, the number of young people out of work is edging back towards a million, and millions are working harder for less.

At least now it brings everybody into line to play cricket together under the same regulations.\nHowever, on pitches which are bound to suit the spinners - an area where India excel - and wear appreciably over the five days of a Test, I imagine the decision will help the Indians immensely.\nPlaying spinners with DRS in place is an altogether different and more challenging prospect than without it and it will make India more difficult to beat for England.\nThat's not the main point though: it's good India have joined in with what everyone else has been doing for a few years.\nIndia v England tour schedule\nThat's an interesting question and many of the answers lie in the fact there has been a changing of the guard at the top of Indian cricket recently.\nThat has brought about a much more open mind to these things.

For instance, you can't just plant your pad and play around the ball because of the risk of getting out lbw.\nWe've seen in the current Test match in Chittagong how central the DRS system is to games on the subcontinent.\nMoeen Ali overturned three lbw decisions to remain at the crease and score a determined 68.\nThose decisions were reversed because the ball was shown to be missing the stumps, but if it comes down to fine margins and the umpire has already given a batsman out then it will stay that way.\nThat's the challenge for England, and one which they are dealing with in Bangladesh at the moment.\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Marc Higginson\nMedia playback is not supported on this device",

This is not a done deal process.\"\nThe consultation ends on 23 October, and Mr Farry said he wanted to present options to the Northern Ireland Executive in the autumn.",

It really shows their commitment against Occupy Central.\"\nThe large turnout is a reminder there is still no consensus in the battle for Hong Kong's political future.\nIn the other camp, pro-democracy activists from the \"Occupy Central\" group have said they would mobilise protesters to take over some of the busier areas of the central business district if electoral reform is not put in place.\nCity authorities say such an occupation would be illegal however, and argue that it could tarnish Hong Kong's reputation.\nHong Kong's next elections will take place in 2017, and China says it will introduce universal suffrage for the vote.\nHowever the current Chief Executive of Hong Kong CY Leung was elected by a committee largely loyal to the Chinese government.\nThe pro-democracy protesters fear that the shortlist of candidates to replace him will be a similar group also loyal to Beijing.\nThe chief executive is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee. A majority of the representatives are viewed as pro-Beijing.\nThe Chinese government has promised direct elections for the leader, known as the chief executive, by 2017.\nHowever, voters will only have a choice from a list of candidates selected by a nominating committee, and Beijing has said all candidates must be \"patriotic\".\nActivists fear China will use the committee to screen out candidates it disapproves of.",

They stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party.\nOur business editor points out that the board has \"carefully not given a view.

And so he will need some help.\n\"Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,\" says Prof Kingston. \"There is a shrewd political calculus at work here.\"\nWhat he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.",

There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another.\nFor example, 10,000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost, depending on a person's height and weight alone, the study said.\nDr David Ellis, lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University, said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height, weight, percentage of body fat, heart rate and more.\n\"However, because manufactures do not share the algorithms [which are constantly updated] used to determine calories burned, it is almost impossible to know the exact source of error at this stage,\" he said.\nFitness trackers can have a very positive effect on people's activity levels, so complete 100% accuracy may not be vital if the devices are encouraging more exercise.\nBut recent trials have suggested that wearing them doesn't always result in a positive outcome, or improve the chances of losing weight.\nThe researchers urged companies to be more transparent and publish the results of their own accuracy tests.\nThey said this would ensure the public and clinicians were aware of the devices' limitations.\nThe Stanford team has set up their own website to share this kind of data with others.",

He told a press conference it could take a year to come up with a new plan, and that Switzerland risked losing foreign investment as a result.\nCurrently Switzerland grants special status to foreign firms which allows cantons, or districts, to offer them lower rates of tax than domestic firms, making Switzerland an attractive destination for foreign investors.\nBut international organisations such as the OECD have deemed the system unacceptable and Switzerland has made a commitment to reform it by 2019.\nTo avoid raising taxes for multinational companies too sharply the government had agreed to abolish the special status for multinationals but instead offer new tax breaks for research and development and other activities.\nAs part of the proposal, Switzerland's cantons planned to lower their tax rates for businesses across the board, including domestic business, helping to avoid steep rises in tax bills when foreign firms' status was brought into line.\nSome of the resulting budget shortfall in the cantons would have been plugged by federal funds.\nBut the plan was opposed by Social Democrats, Greens, trade unions and churches who argued that the reduced tax revenue would still lead to cuts in public services or higher personal taxes.\n\"The conservative parties wanted to push through tax reform with arrogance and haughtiness against the interests of the people.

Because economic forecasters have said that leaving the European Union would mean the economy would grow by less than it would have done.

It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying.\nBut somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply.\nAnd crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares.\nBut the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say \"we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had\". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time.\nApple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets.\nRevenue from Greater China, once seen as Apple's next growth hope, fell 30% in the quarter, after dropping 33% in the previous quarter.\nIn the same period last year, revenue from Greater China doubled.\nApple's shares were down 3% at about $114.80 in after-hours trading.\n\"Apple didn't have a great [fourth quarter] as iPhones, Macs, China, the US and what appears to be Watch were down,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\nNet income fell to $9.01bn in the fourth quarter, down from $11bn in the same quarter last year.\nFor the year, net income fell to $45.7bn from $53.4bn.\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said it was \"impossible to know\" if there was any effect yet from rival Samsung halting production of Galaxy Note 7 phones earlier this month.",

In 2014, the UK's contribution to the EU budget - the amount we paid to Brussels - was actually \u00a3276m a week.\nIf Britain were to give up the rebate, then the UK would have to pay the gross contribution, and it should be noted that the rebate is not a permanent feature of Britain's membership of the EU.\nBut we do not pay the gross contribution at the moment, the rebate is safe until 2020, and Britain has a veto over the process that would remove or reduce it.\nSir Andrew Dilnot is particularly concerned about suggestions from Vote Leave that a sum of money equivalent to the gross contribution could be spent on other priorities such as the NHS, when some of it is not spent at all (the rebate) and some of it is currently used to support UK farmers, for example.\nREAD MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate",

Where do differences still lie?\nIt was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy.\nBut for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist.\nLiam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years.\nAs one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter.\nBut anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a \"disaster\" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period.\nThen what form will any transition take?\nCould there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent.\nShould we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit?\nThe EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table.\nSo while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved.\nAnd, of course, I use the term 'Remainer\" historically - the cabinet is also united on leaving the EU but the question is how.\nThere has been talk of soft, hard and clean Brexits. Increasingly another word has entered the lexicon.\nDavid Davis uses it. Michael Gove used it today. Expect to hear more of it. Pragmatic. That's now the goal - a pragmatic Brexit.

We're happy to help make sure they remain available,\" said the company's president, Rod Bristow.\nThe move was welcomed by leading academics and museum directors as well as by Turner Prize winners Anish Kapoor, Cornelia Parker and Jeremy Deller.\nMr Kapoor said it was \"a huge relief\" while Mr Deller called it \"a good day for art and culture\" and added: \"Art history is the study of power, politics, identity and humanity, it makes perfect sense to keep the exam.\"\nMs Parker said she had studied art history \"as a working-class girl, receiving free school dinners... It has hugely enriched my life\".\nThe Association of Art Historians hopes the battle to save the A-level will boost the subject's popularity, particularly in the state sector.\n\"The threat to the A-level has galvanised support for art history, which will, I hope, provide a platform for a concerted effort to ensure that more people get the opportunity to study a subject that will enrich their lives,\" said Dr Ben Burbridge of Sussex University who was central to the campaign to save the A-level.",

As it gets worse the trees will develop a diamond-shaped dark-coloured lesion on the bark.\nIn Denmark, Sweden and east European countries, where the disease has been present for 30 years, large numbers of trees have become infected.\nScientists are worried about its impact in Northern Ireland, where ash is a common tree.\nThey are carrying out a survey of more than 1,000 sites to identify any further problems.\nAnd they have asked for the public's help.\nThe authorities have developed a smartphone app called Tree Check that the public can use to report potential problems, including a picture and a GPS position.\nThey will then be assessed and, if necessary, the site visited by experts.\nJim Crummie, plant health expert with the Forest Service urged the public to download the app and to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the authorities in the fight to combat the disease.\nTree Check can be used to report all tree diseases, not just ash dieback.",

It sets expectations high, don't you think? What with its echoes of The Great Exhibition (1851), which was a World Fair and therefore rather different.\nThere was also the famous Art Treasures of Great Britain exhibition, which was held in Manchester in 1857. That was a blockbuster show if ever there was one, with around 1.3 million visitors going to take a look at the 16,000 artworks on display. It ran for just over five months.\nThe team behind the Newcastle-Gateshead bid are hoping to attract three million people in two months to their multi-site showcase of the North of England's contemporary arts and enterprise scene.\nThat's an ambitious target. I hope it, together with the hyperbolic title, doesn't overwhelm the event's programmers and lead them down the Millennium Dome-type route of worthy but dull quasi-educational installations.\nIt should and could be a terrific show, leaving visitors to conclude for themselves that it was a great (with a lowercase G) exhibition.\n\"That level of ambition really did stand out,\" she told BBC News. \"But that doesn't mean this is just for Newcastle-Gateshead.\"\nThe 77-day exhibition will have the overarching theme of The Blazing World - The Fires of Invention.\nNewcastle and Gateshead's joint bid said: \"Inspired by the trailblazers of the north, the exhibition will have several cross-cutting themes for all to respond to, showing how the north's fires of invention continue to transform our world.\n\"Crucially, we will connect artists with scientists and inventors to work closely together, to create new artworks and respond to the great innovations of our time. Arts will meet industry in powerful and memorable ways.\"\nThe region has already proved it can host major art events, with a record 140,000 people visiting the Turner Prize exhibition when it was staged at the Baltic in 2011.\nBut cultural venues in both Newcastle and Gateshead have struggled in the face of local council funding cuts in recent years.\nAs well as the \u00a35m for the exhibition, the government has pledged \u00a315m for a legacy fund, which will be open to cultural organisations across the north.\nMrs Bradley said: \"This is an exhibition for the whole north, and certainly through the legacy work, we are looking for bids across the whole of the north of England so we can really show everything the north has to offer.\"\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",

The new justice minister is also currently drafting a bill on ethics in public life.\nThe allegations were first unveiled in the satirical French newspaper Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9.\nIn its report, it said the organisation led by Mr Ferrand had decided to rent office space from a building his partner was involved in.\nOn the basis of that guaranteed rental income, she was then able to secure a business loan worth about \u20ac402,000 (\u00a3347,000), the paper reports. Renovations carried out by the fund would also have increased the property's value, it added.\nBut Mr Ferrand was quick to address the issue on national television, saying the decision was made with full knowledge of his connection to the building.\n\"The administrators of the board, on which I did not sit, picked the best offer... which was a building owned by my partner,\" he told French broadcaster BFMTV.\nHe also said the buildings were still being used years later - indicating satisfaction with the arrangement.\nHe described the story as a \"pseudo-scandal\" and a \"welcome present\" for the beginning of his public life.\nA government spokesman, Christophe Castaner, said that while the disclosure comes as a \"bad time\", there was no question of the minister resigning, or any suggestion of illegality.\nLe Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 also alleged that Mr Ferrand's son had worked as a parliamentary assistant in 2014, which the minister dismissed as minor work which lasted for only four months.\nMr Ferrand has been appointed by President Macron as minister for territorial cohesion - a job he was picked for after helping the president to electoral victory as secretary general of the political party La R\u00e9publique en Marche (Republic on the move).\nFinancial dealing between family members has become a political hot potato in France since the revelation last year - also by Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 - that presidential hopeful Francois Fillon had paid his wife for parliamentary work.\nMedia reports questioned whether she had actually performed the work she was paid for, and the controversy damaged his campaign, arguably clearing the way for Emmanuel Macron's victory.",

Under the European law which it replaces companies could be asked to retain data for 24 months.\nMore controversially the new law will also produce what is being described as a \"clearer legal framework\" to allow access to the content of calls, texts and emails after a warrant is signed by a senior government minister. Telecoms companies are said to have warned ministers that after the Edward Snowden revelations they are vulnerable to legal challenge by their customers.\nThe Labour MP Tom Watson has condemned the plans as a \"stitch up\" which prevent MPs from considering the legislation properly.",

Before becoming president, Mr Poroshenko had been known as the \"chocolate king\".\nDuring his presidential campaign in 2014, Mr Poroshenko vowed to sell most of his business assets. He won the election and was sworn in in June 2014.

There's still considerable uncertainty about the scale of North Korea's nuclear arsenal.\nRecently Chinese nuclear experts provided their US counterparts with a new assessment of North Korea's nuclear capabilities suggesting it may already have 20 warheads with the capacity to double this total by next year.

No-one expected them to use it all up buying an annuity. No-one stopped them from giving cash to whoever they chose to give it to.\nSimilarly, 100 days ago, the chancellor gave current savers the right to do what they wanted with their pension pots once they made landfall on the wrong side of 55 years of age.\nThe move has prompted a wave of interest, with hundreds of thousands a week phoning up to find out more.\nMany have discovered that exercising their freedoms is a frustrating process, fraught with delays. But according to the Treasury more than 85,000 people have dipped into their pension plans so far, cashing in \u00a31.3bn.\nAre they like the wary ex-pirates who had to hide their treasure chests and keep a low profile, knowing that any carousing would attract the attention of the King's officers? They are not.\nThese are the ones who have celebrated with a dream holiday or bought a new car or ordered a kitchen extension, although some - more sensibly - have paid off mortgages and other debts.\nThe average withdrawal is just over \u00a315,000, probably not much different in value to the 800 pieces of eight promised by Black Bart.\nNow the insurers who manage pensions have revealed more about the choices being made.\nWhat appears to be happening is that those with small pension pots, of only a few thousand pounds, are rushing to cash them in.\nThose with larger pots are more likely to buy an income for their retirement. But there has been a 75% drop in purchases of old-style annuities.\nInstead, in the first two months of the freedoms \u00a3720m was spent on income drawdown policies, which give you a regular income plus the ability to dip into the underlying cash when you need it.\nSome will take that as an encouraging sign that the over-55s are taking more care with substantial pension plans which really could provide an income for life.\nSource: HM Treasury/ABI\nEven so these are shark-infested waters. People have to watch out for high charges and scam merchants. They have to think about tax as well, because the chancellor is entitled to his share of the treasure.\nPension income has always been taxable, but the revenue can be brought forward by decades if people dip into their funds.\nThe first 25% withdrawn is tax-free, but after that you pay normal income tax. Some who cash in large sums could find they are pushed into the 40% tax bracket.\nPension experts are forecasting that excitement about the reforms will result in a tax windfall for the Treasury this year of hundreds of millions of pounds.\nNot to imply, of course, that there is any likeness between George Osborne and Black Bart the pirate, who met his end in 1722 in a skirmish with the Royal Navy.",

Maintaining public confidence in it will be critical.\nThe Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, said: \"Alison will make an excellent director of public prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years.\n\"I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service.\n\"I'd also like to thank Keir Starmer for the great contribution he has made - not only to the CPS but more generally to the criminal justice system.  He can be proud of the reforms that he and his staff have led to keep our criminal justice system one of the best in the world.\"\nMs Saunders said: \"I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next director of public prosecutions. To lead an organisation of committed and professional staff is an honour, especially having worked for the CPS since its inception.\"\nMs Saunders spent the early part of her career prosecuting in south London before working on CPS policy in relation to child victims and witnesses.\nIn 2001 she became chief crown prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne.\nShe then briefly left the CPS to join government as a deputy legal adviser to the attorney general. On her return, she set up the CPS organised crime division which deals with complex cases including human trafficking, drugs, counterfeiting and money laundering across borders.\nIn 2009 Alison Sanders was named chief crown prosecutor for London, which deals with more than 200,000 cases a year.\nShe oversaw the successful 2012 prosecution of two of the men who attacked and killed Stephen Lawrence in 1993.

If the commission is to properly fulfil its duty to taxpayers we must see improvements in the way it collects, acts upon and publishes information.\"\nThe MPs did also acknowledge that the CQC had made \"substantial progress\" since its previous report into the regulator back in 2012.\nDavid Behan, chief executive of the CQC, said: \"We have always maintained that there is more we have to do, in particular with regards to improving the timeliness of our reports and inspecting all health and adult social care services.\n\"These are not new issues and we have been working hard to improve our performance.

The politics might become way too complicated if the UK tried to change its mind.\nBut who might have the final legal say on what could yet become a critical question?\nArticle 50 is a piece of European law, so the ultimate arbiter on this issue is the European Court of Justice.\nThere is an ongoing case in Dublin at the moment that is seeking to refer the question of irrevocability to the European Court to get a definitive answer.\nOne other point is worth bearing in mind: everyone is talking about a two-year period for negotiating under Article 50, at the end of which the UK would leave the EU.\nBut Article 50 does provide for that two-year period to be extended, if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agreed.\nNo-one is advocating that, but it remains a legal possibility.\nThe argument that Article 50 cannot be reversed once it has been triggered has not been tested in court.\nThe rest of the EU has said it does not want the UK to leave, but - politically speaking - it would be very difficult to revoke notification of Article 50, and the current UK government says it has no intention of doing so.\nRead more from Reality Check",

Therefore, with fees on the rise, it is more important than ever for borrowers to consider the true cost of a mortgage before obtaining a deal,\" said Charlotte Nelson, of Moneyfacts.\n\"Deals with larger fees often allow you to add the fee to the mortgage advance, however, this increases the amount borrowed, pushing up monthly repayments.\n\"The extra saved by opting for a deal with no fee could be better used to overpay the mortgage, which could help borrowers become mortgage-free quicker.\"\nFigures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, property transactions have generally been close to the 100,000 mark each month for the past three years.\nThis climate, in part, has resulted in lenders launching new products to try to attract new borrowers, often with very low rates.\nMoneyfacts said that, for those with a \u00a3150,000 mortgage and repaying over 25 years, some deals with the lowest rates on the market have fees of around \u00a32,000, with one as high as \u00a34,000.\nThe average fee for these customers was now \u00a31,018, compared with \u00a3986 a year ago, and \u00a3886 in July 2014.",

Italian Parmitano is a first-timer.\nThey arrived at the orbiting platform five hours and 46 minutes later.\nTheir Soyuz capsule was using a new flight profile that dramatically reduces the rendezvous time from the traditional two days.\nIt is technically more difficult and requires some very precise orbital adjustments, but it is deemed to be easier on the crew because it means they do not have to spend so long inside their cramped vehicle.\nLeak and pressure checks were conducted following docking at the station, with a hatch opening at 04:14 GMT.\nThe trio, whose designation is Expedition 36, were greeted with hugs and smiles by the three individuals already on the ISS - Russians Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin, and American Chris Cassidy.\nThe new crew members will be given a week of light duties in which to acclimatise to their weightless surroundings.

Being an astronaut is about walking in space. For me, they are one and the same thing,\" he told BBC News.\nOne of the spacewalks will help prepare the ISS for the arrival of Russia's big science laboratory, which will grow the 420-tonne complex still further.\nThe lab will come up with Europe's major robotic contribution to the platform - a large arm that is able to move around the station to conduct work wherever it is needed.\nBorn in the Sicilian town of Paterno, Parmitano expects to bring a strong Italian flavour to his stay in orbit - literally. Italian chefs have prepared a range of special astronaut foods for him, including lasagne and risotto.\nThese will be delivered to the ISS in the coming weeks on the European robotic freighter Albert Einstein.\nFyodor Yurchikhin, Karen Nyberg and Luca Parmitano are due back on Earth on 10 November.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

The party leader automatically takes on the role of prime minister.\nAlthough Mr Erdogan's son-in-law, Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, had been mentioned as a possible candidate, his name did not feature among the top three men in a survey of MPs and party members.\nPresident Erdogan is hoping to move Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential system, with greater executive powers.\nThe choice of Binali Yildirim as frontrunner for the AKP's leadership has surprised few in Turkey, as he has been an Erdogan favourite for years. He has remained loyal in the most troubling times, and that loyalty appears to have paid off.\nHe has served as transport minister for many years, and did not hesitate to resign from his post to run for the mayoral elections in the western city of Izmir, a secular stronghold, at Mr Erdogan's request.\nHis name had come up as a possible candidate for the party leadership at last year's AKP congress. And that forced Mr Davutoglu to concede some of his powers within the party.\nOne AKP MP had to apologise after suggesting that the next prime minister would be a \"low-profile\" name. However, many in Turkey believe he will pose little threat to Mr Erdogan.\nAmong the reforms planned by the AKP is a proposal going before parliament on Friday to lift the immunity of MPs who are under investigation.\nThe measure is seen as targeting the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) as well as the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\nThe HDP fears its 59 MPs could face prosecution and expulsion from parliament on charges of backing Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants. The large number of pro-Kurdish MPs in parliament has also hindered Mr Erdogan's aim of pushing through increased presidential powers.\nA ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK ended weeks after elections in June 2015 and the renewed conflict has claimed hundreds of lives on both sides, particularly in Turkey's south-east.\nMr Erdogan has called for pro-Kurdish MPs to face terrorism charges and Friday's vote could be a first step towards making that happen.\nIf the government secures the support of 367 of parliament's 550 MPs, it will go through directly. If 330 MPs back the measure, then it could be put to a popular vote. A referendum is seen as more likely because 348 MPs supported the plan in a preliminary vote earlier this week.",

Iran has also denied involvement in the attack.\nMs Fein told a local radio station on Tuesday that the draft warrant was \"on file\", and that a previous statement from her office saying that no such draft had been found was \"erroneous\".\nOpposition newspaper Clarin had published a copy of the draft on Monday.\nThe document, dating from June 2014, requested the arrest of President Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman.\nHowever, it was not included in a 300-page report submitted by Mr Nisman to a federal court days before his death.\nUnder Argentine law, the president and the foreign minister could only be arrested if Congress first lifted the immunity granted to them as members of the executive.\nHoracio Verbitsky, one of Argentina's most experienced journalists and human rights investigators, told me in his Buenos Aires flat last week: \"There's no point trying to speculate who killed Nisman, because we just don't know.\"\nMr Verbitsky is, of course, dead right. Alberto Nisman probably alienated many people as, with the zealous attitude of a man on a mission, he put the finishing touches to his controversial report into the 1994 bombing. But that does not mean any of the people he criticised in the report were responsible for his death.\nHaving initially dramatically denied the existence of the draft arrest warrants by ripping up copies of the newspaper that first carried the reports, a government spokesman has now been forced into an embarrassing climb-down, and that does look bad for the president.\nSo does the apparent pressure the government continues to put on case investigators and fringe players by relentlessly commenting on what should be an independent judicial investigation.\nWhat is particularly worrying here, beyond the personal tragedy of Alberto Nisman's death, is not that this happened in Argentina - such murky deeds could happen in any city in any country. It is the fact that most Argentines clearly do not expect their government or its institutions to get to the truth, just as the 1992 and 1994 atrocities remain unresolved.\nWhen Clarin first published the draft warrant, the government reacted angrily, dismissing the report as \"garbage\".\nPresident Fernandez had also originally described Mr Nisman's death as suicide.\nHowever, in a televised speech last week, the president suggested that rogue elements in Argentina's intelligence service had fed Mr Nisman false information and manipulated him.\nShe announced plans to dismantle the Intelligence Secretariat (SI) and called for a special session of Congress to discuss a draft bill to that effect.",

But they are not your usual briquettes.\nBriquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers.\nBut briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me.\nSo the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills.\nSometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests.\nThe practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank.\nCentral bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes.

It's the mother tongue of the elite and effectively the official language of the central government. Then there is the growing number of parents who now aspire to give their children an education through the medium of that language. But is the craze for English an unmixed blessing?\nBack in the sixties the British regarded Indian English as something of a joke. The comic actor Peter Sellers had mocked it so comprehensively that I found it well nigh impossible to get the BBC to allow anyone with even the faintest Indian accent on the air.\nIn India, we native English speakers laughed at quaint phrases like \"please do the necessary and oblige\", or more simply \"please do the needful\", and \"it is suggested that the meeting be preponed\", which appeared regularly in Indian official correspondence.\nA senior British diplomat once suggested that his PA should find some less geographically specific way of answering the telephone when he couldn't take the call than saying, \"Sahib is not on his seat\". Much to the diplomat's dismay a colleague told him that his PA had misunderstood the instruction and been even more specific. He'd told the colleague, \"Sahib is in the lavatory.\"\nNow with Indian writers carrying off the major literary awards, and Westerners in the IT and BPO industries talking of being \"bangalored\" when they are replaced by English-speaking Indians, Indian English is anything but a joke.\nBut could the very success of English in India \"bangalore\" India's own languages?\nThe linguist Professor David Crystal speaking in Delhi said: \"A language is dying every two weeks somewhere in the world today. Half the world's languages will no longer be spoken in another century. This is an extremely serious concern, and English has to share the blame.\" Others put it less politely, describing English as a killer language.\nBut should India worry if English kills off some of its 22 officially recognised and hundreds of its not-so-official languages?\nPerhaps the answer is no.\nIn his book comparing the future of India, China, and Japan, the former editor of The Economist, Bill Emmott, said India fell short of China in almost every measure except the ability to speak English.\nSo why shouldn't India build on its one advantage? One practical reason is because, looking back over the history of India since it became independent in 1947, it is clear that any threat to Indian languages has the potential to provoke a violent backlash.\nMark Tully is a writer and former BBC India correspondent.

In this case, each fringe is a step of 2.8cm.\n\u201cThe InSAR data show that the earthquake has warped the Earth's surface by a maximum of 23cm, causing subsidence in a 25km-long elongate region roughly between the towns of Norcia and Amatrice,\u201d explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK, who built the map.\n\u201cThe fault that ruptured was around 20km long. The average slip at depth on the fault was about half a metre, but is concentrated in two major patches, which probably means two separate fault segments ruptured together.\n\u201cMost slip took place at depth, with only a small amount reaching the surface.\u201d\nDr Walters is affiliated to Britain\u2019s NERC Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET).\nTo make the map, he used radar data from the European Union\u2019s Sentinel-1a and 1b satellites.\nThese spacecraft circle the globe, routinely imaging all land surfaces at least once every six days.\nTheir rapid return to any one location means they were in a position to view central Italy as soon as Friday after the quake, and then again on Saturday.\nDr Walters\u2019 point about most of the slip being at depth illustrates the usefulness of InSAR.\nNot all ruptures will show an obvious surface expression, such as a buckled road or a newly opened fissure in the ground.\nBut the InSAR data, in revealing the scale of warping, still permits scientists to trace the fault involved even if some of its sections are somewhat hidden.\nThis was true of 2009\u2019s damaging quake in L\u2019Aquila, to the south of Amatrice, which killed 309 people.\nSurface breaks were small and geologists initially had some difficulty in identifying the fault responsible for the magnitude-6.3 event.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

It also has more luggage capacity.\n\"We see this [car] as being very easy to drive on a day-to-day basis,\" Mr Flewitt said.\nAbout a quarter of the new \u00a31bn investment will go directly into research and development, Mr Flewitt said. This will include work on an all-electric prototype. Electric sportscar technology is advancing fast, led by the likes of Tesla.\nHe also hopes that the new range of cars will bring down the age profile of a typical McLaren buyer, which is 40-plus in Europe. However, the typical Chinese buyer is in his or her 20s.\nThe Track 22 plan will involve McLaren Automotive adding about 500 staff to its existing 1,500. A second production shift has already started at the company's factory at Woking, Surrey, and a recruitment drive has begun.\nMany of the jobs will be skilled engineering roles. Mr Flewitt said the market for good engineers is \"undoubtedly getting more competitive.\" But he added: \"Luckily, McLaren is an attractive brand to come and work for.\"\nMore than 90% of McLaren's output is for export, and the company has seen sales fall in China as the economy slows.\nIs he worried about the health of the global economy? \"You worry about it all the time. The strategy we took was to make sure we had broad distribution.\n\"We sell cars into 30 markets, with 82 dealerships. As one market comes down - China has dropped this year and last year - other markets strengthen,\" he said.",

With subsequent payments, that figure has risen to \u00a31bn.\nFurther value is left in the \"bad bit\" of the bank, which was hived off under the UK Asset Resolution scheme, which is now returning profits to the Treasury.\nSo has the government got its money back? Probably, although it is very difficult to quantify the actual costs of the multiple bailouts, of which Northern Rock was only one.\nVirgin Money has 75 branches throughout the UK and has 2.8 million customers.\nIt employs 2,800 people, of whom 1,800 work at its centre of operations in Gosforth.\nIn November 2011, Virgin Money bought the banking and mortgage lending arm of the old Northern Rock bank, which was bailed out by the Bank of England in the autumn of 2007 at the start of the international banking crisis.\nNorthern Rock was nationalised in early 2008 and then in 2010 it was split in two - Northern Rock plc  and Northern Rock (Asset Management), into which was placed its bad debt.\nVirgin Money's final \u00a350m payment will take the amount it has paid the Treasury for Northern Rock to \u00a31.02bn.\nLast week, another UK challenger bank, Aldermore, announced its own plans to float this month, saying it hoped to raise \u00a375m.\nWhile Virgin Money is a retail-only bank, Aldermore, founded in May 2009, is a specialist bank that concentrates on lending to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as to homeowners.",

There is currently no screening available, so patients have to rely on seeing a doctor and being correctly diagnosed in time.\nAnother important factor in the survival rate is whether surgery is carried out by a specialist surgeon, the researchers said.\nMany women were currently operated on by general surgeons, possibly because the true nature of the illness came to light only during surgery.\nCancer charity Ovarian Cancer Action said the new test could be useful.\n\"Anything that makes a diagnosis of ovarian cancer easier, earlier and quicker - like this tumour blood marker test - that gets women tailored treatment sooner, is very much needed,\" said chief executive Katherine Taylor.\nIf women were diagnosed in the early stages of ovarian cancer they had a 90% chance of surviving the next five years, but if the cancer was found at a later stage, the five-year survival rate reduced to 22%, she said.\n\"Awareness of this disease among women and GPs is key,\" she added. \"Ovarian cancer is the UK's most deadly gynaecological disease, with over 7,000 cases diagnosed every year.\"",

        "output": "A senior Pakistani Taliban commander, Latif Mehsud, has reportedly been handed over to Pakistan by the US from Afghanistan."
