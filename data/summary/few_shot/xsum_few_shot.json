NHS England said the data was being reviewed.\nIt also said it was reviewing the delivery system in the South West but that the county's rural nature made a schools-based programme \"more challenging\".\nThe vaccine is offered in schools across most of England, but in Cornwall 12 to 13 year olds must see GPs for the jabs.\nRobert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said the vaccine would \"have a major impact on reducing incidences of cervical cancer\" in the UK.\n\"We have been calling for a couple of years now to change how the programme works in Cornwall,\" he said.\n\"A schools-based programme means you can offer it to kids while they're at school rather than having to take them out to have the vaccine twice.\"\nThe HPV vaccination is offered in two separate injections over a one-year period but up until last year it was three jabs. It protects against two strains of the sexually transmitted infection believed to cause 70% of cervical cancer cases.\nUptake in Cornwall has remained well below the national average for the past five years.\nHowever, Dr Sarah Gray, GP Specialist in Women's Health, said the way the figures were recorded was misleading: \"What NHS England have counted is the number of jabs in a school year.\n\"If they don't quite get all three within a year it looks like we've failed,\" she said.\nShe also said Cornwall was doing well at immunising older teenage girls.\nLouise Blenkinsop from Falmouth, 32, recovered from cervical cancer in 2013 after \"gruelling treatment\" and was left unable to have children.\n\"It is ridiculous that Cornwall is being overlooked. Provision should be made equal across the country,\" she said.\nNHS England is responsible for commissioning the vaccine on behalf of Public Health England.\nA spokesman said: \"Cornwall is a very rural county with a number of factors which make a school based model logistically more challenging to deliver than it would be in many other parts of the country.\"\nHe said the system was being reviewed \"to assess both clinical effectiveness and value for money\" and that checks were  being done on last year's data to make sure it was accurate.",
