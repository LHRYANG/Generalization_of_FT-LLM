Everton captain Phil Jagielka carried the robot, which fed panoramic live images and sound back to Jack's tablet. A microphone enabled him to chat with players in the Goodison Park tunnel. The robot, called AV1, was made by Norwegian firm No Isolation and was designed to help youngsters with long-term illness battle loneliness and attend school from home. The company has worked with UK charity WellChild to give Liverpool teenager Jack, who has much-reduced mobility, an unforgettable experience. Jack needs oxygen 24 hours a day which means he can never attend a match at Goodison Park, even though he lives just under two miles away. His mother Michelle Wignall said it was a \"once in a lifetime experience\" for her son. Everton's head of engagement Scott McLeod said: \"We are thrilled to have had the chance to do this for Jack and we hope it has provided him with a memory he will always treasure.\" Karen Dolva, chief executive and co-founder of No Isolation, said: \"For Jack, the dream of being a mascot for his favourite football club was not likely to happen given his condition.\"",

The charity was founded in the 13th Century, and set up Bristol's part in the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the 17th Century. It now oversees and manages nine primary and secondary schools, provides housing for older people and also owns several buildings in the city. Mr Brown has called for it to open up Clifton's Merchants' Hall, which is currently used as a conference and wedding venue. \"They can put it out to commercial interests or projects or we can put some black businesses up there,\" Mr Brown explained. He also added that a lot of positive work had been done with the charity over the past five years, helped by the appointment of Marti Burgess. Also taking part in Beyond statues? How can we make Bristol more equal? debate was charity project worker, Sakiya Ghalib, who works for the social cohesion organisation, Integrate UK, broadcaster, Patrick Hart, and academic and social entrepreneur Dr Marie-Annick Gournet.

        "input": "By Lisa McAlisterBBC News NI Matilda Winkleman has undergone several operations for severe burns since it happened last year and is now recovering. But what should parents consider when they're buying a fancy dress outfit? Firstly Halloween costumes are classed as toys which means that, by law, they don't have to be as fire retardant as normal children's clothing. Some stores have voluntarily agreed to make theirs as resistant as children's nightwear. BBC News NI tested four costumes bought randomly from a variety of stores. The good news is all four performed well, all self-extinguished and didn't accelerate into a fireball. One costume said on the label it had been subjected to additional fire safety testing and it performed the best. Kevin O'Neill from the Fire and Rescue Service said: \"These are toys. Toys have a lower fire safety requirement. They have a lower fire safety standard. Just be aware of that and take measures. \"One of those measures is to ensure children are wearing clothes under the costume. \"They should be wearing woollen tights for example or a woollen jumper or jeans. That way it gives some protection that if they were to catch fire you've still got a barrier between the garment and your skin\". If the worst does happen, Mr O'Neill said children should know the 'stop, drop and roll' drill. \"Stop what you're doing, get on the ground and roll. Allow the ground to be the means of suffocating a fire and not a person's hands\".",
        "output": "The case of TV presenter Claudia Winkleman's daughter, whose Halloween costume brushed by a candle and burst into flames, has put the issue of fire safety firmly in the headlines."
