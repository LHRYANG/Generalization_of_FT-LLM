        "input": " Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his massive compound. CNN's Sara Sidner got a peek at the passageways Friday. She dubbed it \"Gadhafi's inner sanctum.\" The correspondent, who's been covering the battle of Tripoli, walked down steps into a pitch-dark tunnel and used a flashlight to navigate an underworld described as \"massive.\" So far, she said, rebels have cleared about 700 meters of underground passages. The tunnel network is believed to extend all the way to the city's international airport and the Rixos hotel. That's where 33 journalists and two foreign nationals were held for five days by pro-Gadhafi forces. It also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where Gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels. The tunnels Sidner saw are wide enough for adults to walk side by side. She spotted a golf cart that can easily fit in the corridors. Sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth: A thick wall, a massive door and a sturdy lock. A charred ceiling, couches and beds where a fire apparently occurred. Pieces of metal and shrapnel. A section where NATO bombs fell and the roof caved in. Another room contained videotapes lined up on a shelf, part of a TV studio where Gadhafi may have recorded messages. \"It's set up like a survival bunker,\" Sidner said in an on-air report. \"There is literally a city under here.\"",
        "output": "CNN's Sara Sidner sees another world in a tunnel below Tripoli .\nGadhafi may have recorded his taped messages in a studio there .\nRebels are methodically searching through the winding passages ."

        "input": " World number one Caroline Wozniacki suffered another morale-sapping defeat at the French Open as she was dumped out by 28th seed Daniela Hantuchova. The Dane, who is yet to win a Grand Slam tournament, was beaten 6-1 6-3 in just 73 minutes to extend her miserable run at Roland Garros. Her best performance in Paris was reaching the quarterfinals in 2009 and she struggled against Hantuchova, from Slovakia, who was competing in her 41st major. Hantuchova reeled off nine straight games to seal the opening set and take a commanding lead in the second but Woznaicki offered herself hope when she secured her first break to reduce the deficit to 4-2. But Hantuchova held serve twice to seal one of the biggest victories of her career and set up a meeting with 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the last 16, after she beat Canadian Rebecca Marino 6-0 6-4. \"She played very well today, better than me for sure,\" Wozniacki told a press conference. \"She knew what she wanted to do and I need to get back on the court and practice and come back stronger. \"Kim had a tough loss yesterday and I had a tough loss today and that's what can happen. Since we are number one and two we must be doing something right. \"I am young and I get experience every time and you learn more from your losses than from your wins.\" After Wozniacki's exit, and Kim Clijsters defeat on Thursday, the trend for upsets continued as Australian 8th seed Samantha Stosur was beaten by unseeded Gisela Dulko. The Argentine set the tone by taking the first four games of the match, and though she dropped the second set, Stosur's 35 unforced errors counted as Dulko wrapped up the match. Afterwards, she told a press conference she was dedicating her victory to her brother's twins, Myla and Teo, who were born overnight. \"Yesterday night I was awake really late,\" she said. \"You know, it was very emotional, because I would have loved to be there, but I'm here. The key to the match was to start well, to be aggressive from the start,\" Stosur added: \"She seemed to be out ahead a little bit better and really kind of be the one dictating the points, which, for me, I'm usually the one able to do that.\" Elsewhere, defending champion and fifth seed, Francesca Schiavone, from Italy, had no such trouble making the fourth round after her Chinese opponent Shuai Peng retired hurt with the score at 6-3 1-2. Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva beat Anastasia Rodionova, from Austria, 6-2 6-3 and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the 14th seed, triumphed over Nuria Llagostera Vives, from Spain, 3-6 6-3 6-3. Serb Jelena Jankovic, the 10th seed, beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands, from the United States, 6-2 6-2, while 11th seed Marion Bartoli, from France, beat Julia Goerges, from Germany, 3-6 6-2 6-4.",

        "input": " A Detroit man, who stabbed an officer outside a courtroom and escaped wearing the officer's uniform, has been captured, authorities said. The inmate, Abraham Pearson, was spotted walking in a Detroit neighborhood Monday night, said Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon. Authorities said Pearson attacked a deputy with a sharpened comb in front of two other inmates inside a holding cell at the Frank Murphy Hall Monday morning. He then handcuffed Deputy Harrison Tolliver, and fled, also taking the officer's cell phone and radio, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office said. The two inmates did not intervene or leave the cell, according to police. Pearson escaped from the rear of the building, carjacked a citizen and drove away in a Dodge minivan. The Dodge was recovered and the officer's uniform was found under a vehicle near Beaubien Street in Detroit. Pearson was facing sentencing on Monday on carjacking and armed robbery charges. According to the sheriff's office, the 25-year old has a lengthy criminal record and was on parole. The arrest could add at least 11 more charges to the crimes he was already facing, Napoleon said. Tolliver, 63, was taken to the Detroit Receiving Hospital and later released. Tolliver is a retired Detroit police officer who joined the Sheriff's Office in December. CNN's Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.",

She said she refuses to be part of what she sees as \"the takedown culture\" surrounding celebrities. \"You have celebrities who are pushed to the brink of a public meltdown, and so the public thinks that every person in the public eye has dirty secrets that they're keeping, or isn't what they seem, or is masking it and faking sincerity, faking authenticity, faking being surprised at award shows when you win a Grammy,\" she said.",
